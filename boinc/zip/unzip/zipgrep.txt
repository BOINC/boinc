NAME
       zipgrep - search files in a ZIP archive for lines matching
       a pattern

SYNOPSIS
       zipgrep [egrep_options] pattern  file[.zip]  [file(s) ...]
       [-x xfile(s) ...]

DESCRIPTION
       zipgrep  will  search files within a ZIP archive for lines
       matching the given string or pattern.  zipgrep is a  shell
       script  and  requires  egrep(1) and unzip(1L) to function.
       Its output is identical to that of egrep(1).

ARGUMENTS
       pattern
              The pattern to be located  within  a  ZIP  archive.
              Any   string  or  regular  expression  accepted  by
              egrep(1) may be used.  file[.zip] Path of  the  ZIP
              archive.  (Wildcard expressions for the ZIP archive
              name are not supported.)  If the  literal  filename
              is  not  found,  the suffix .zip is appended.  Note
              that self-extracting ZIP files  are  supported,  as
              with  any  other ZIP archive; just specify the .exe
              suffix (if any) explicitly.

       [file(s)]
              An optional list of  archive  members  to  be  pro-
              cessed,  separated  by  spaces.  If no member files
              are specified, all members of the ZIP  archive  are
              searched.   Regular  expressions (wildcards) may be
              used to match multiple members:

              *      matches a sequence of 0 or more characters

              ?      matches exactly 1 character

              [...]  matches any single  character  found  inside
                     the  brackets;  ranges  are  specified  by a
                     beginning character, a hyphen, and an ending
                     character.   If  an  exclamation  point or a
                     caret (`!' or `^') follows the left bracket,
                     then  the  range  of  characters  within the
                     brackets is complemented (that is,  anything
                     except the characters inside the brackets is
                     considered a match).

              (Be sure to quote any character that  might  other-
              wise  be  interpreted  or modified by the operating
              system.)

       [-x xfile(s)]
              An optional list of archive members to be  excluded
              from  processing.   Since wildcard characters match

ZIPGREP(1L)                                           ZIPGREP(1L)

              directory separators (`/'), this option may be used
              to  exclude  any  files that are in subdirectories.
              For example, ``zipgrep grumpy foo *.[ch]  -x  */*''
              would  search  for  the  string ``grumpy'' in all C
              source files in the main directory of  the  ``foo''
              archive,  but  none in any subdirectories.  Without
              the -x option, all C source files in  all  directo-
              ries within the zipfile would be searched.

OPTIONS
       All  options  prior to the ZIP archive filename are passed
       to egrep(1).
