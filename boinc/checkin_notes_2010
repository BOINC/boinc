    - client: scheduling problem:
        - a project overestimates job FLOP counts
        - the client starts jobs in EDF mode
        - as job progresses and fraction done increases,
            its completion time estimate decreases until
            it's no longer a deadline miss.
        - job gets preempted by other job from that project;
            you end up with lots of partly completed jobs.
        Solution (I hope): if an app version has running jobs,
            compute a "temp DCF" for the app version,
            which is the min of dynamic/static estimates for its jobs.
            Apply this scaling factor to completion time estimates
            for unstarted jobs in RR simulation
    - client: the estimation of remaining time of running jobs was wrong
        (how did this bug survive so long?)

    - API: if app can't acquire lock file, tell the client not
        to restart app for 10 minutes.
        Hopefully what will happen is:
        - another instance of app is running in slot dir
            (shouldn't happen, but sometimes does)
        - that app will eventually finish, and will write
            a checkpoint file saying so.
            It will call boinc_finish(0), but the client won't notice
            that it has exited.
        - the next time the client starts the app,
            it will acquire lock, see that it's done,
            and call boinc_finish(0).
            This time the client will notice,
            and the job will be reported as correct.
        The downside to all this is that the client won't know
        that the CPU is in use, and will schedule NCPUS jobs.

    - client/manager: eliminate duplicate notices.
        When appending a new notice, we check whether one with
        the same title and description is present already.
        If so we remove one or the other, depending on the situation.

        This introduces the possibility of "holes" in the seqno space.
        In order that the manager learns of these deletions,
        we use the following mechanism:
        whenever a notice is removed (because it's a dup or too old)
        a flag is set in each GUI_RPC_CONN.
        On the next get_notice() RPC, the client returns the entire
        list of notices, preceded by a dummy notice with seqno=-1;
        this tells the RPC stub function to replace the current list
        rather than appending to it.

    - Mac Sandbox: The init_data.xml file in each slot directory also contains
        an authenticator; to keep these private, change ownership of the "slots"
        directory to boinc_master:boinc_project and eliminate read and execute
        permissions of this directory for "other".  For consistency, make the
        same changes to the "projects" directory.  The individual slot and
        project directories are still world-executable and they and their
        contents are still world-readable, so the Client can still read files
        created by project apps with ownership boinc_project:boinc_project.
      - NOTE: I believe this should not cause any problems for either BOINC or
        project applications, but it needs to be tested thoroughly.

    - various components: fix inconsistencies in how user names
        and team names are represented.
        In particular, edit_user_info_action.php was using
        htmlentities() on names; this led to double-encoding.

        The new rules:
        1) no HTML tags allowed in either one.
            This is enforced silently, using strip_tags()
        2) names are stored in the DB exactly as entered.
            They may contain chars like & and >.
            They may contain non-ASCII characters
            (use UTF-8 if you want them displayed correctly).
            None of these are not escaped.
        3) When the names are put in XML
            (e.g. in scheduler reply or db_dump output)
            they are XML-escaped.
            This escapes <, &, and non-ASCII chars
        4) The client leaves them in this form,
            and writes them that way in GUI RPCs
            and init_data.xml files.
        5) The parsing of GUI RPC replies and init_data.xml files
            XML-unescapes them.

        height and width were saved in the Manager settings.  But this meant
        that when we add an item to the dialog, it is too small until the
        user expands it.  And Modal dialogs like this should not be resizeable.
        I also made the dialog no longer resizeable by the user.

    - server: various changes;
        see http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/wiki/CreditNew

        Projects will need to update DB and recompile all back-end programs.

        Summary:
        - new way of computing credit
        - "reliable host" mechanism is per app version
        - "host punishment" mechanism is per app version
        - adjustment of wu.rsc_fpops_est provides the
            equivalent of per app version DCF
        - max jobs in progress is now per app
        - max jobs per RPC is now per app

        TODO:
        - reliable mechanism:
            - populate and use host_app_version.error_rate
            - populate host_app_version.turnaround
        - host punishment:
            - populate host_app_version.max_jobs_per_day
            - populate host_app_version.n_jobs_today
            - use app.max_jobs_per_day_init
        - job limits:
            - use app.max_jobs_in_progress, max_gpu_jobs_in_progress
            - use app.max_jobs_per_rpc
        - adjust wu.rsc_fpops_est
        - remove old credit stuff

    - backend programs: change the way PFC and elapsed-time statistics

        The incremental approach was bogus.
        New approach:
        host_app_version: write directly; R/W interval is tiny
        app_version: maintain an explicit list of update samples
            for both PFC and credit.
            When the validator flushes its app_version cache,
            do careful updates.
        Note: when using double fields in careful updates,
        you can't test for equality.  Use abs(new-old) < 1e-N

David  9 Apr 2010
    - scheduler and validator: distinguish between
        1) peak FLOPS (based on benchmarks or GPU attributes).
            This does not change over time.
            It's not adjusted on the basis of statistics.
            It's not affected by wu.rsc_fpops_est.
            It can be compared across projects.
        versus
        2) projected FLOPS: the scheduler's best guess as to what will satisfy
            X * elapsed_time = wu.rsc_fpops_est;
            this is used to make server-side runtime estimates,
            and it's sent to the client and used for its runtime estimates.
            It may be based on the (host, app version) elapsed time average.
        My checkin [21153] mistakently confounded these two.

        Notes:
        1) app_plan() now must return both peak and projected FLOPS.
        2) result.flops_estimate stores peak FLOPS
        3) the <flops> field in app_info.xml files should be
            projected FLOPS.  But its accuracy is not important;
            it's not used once the server has statistics
            for the (host, app version)

    - server: change the following from per-host to per-(host, app version):
        - daily quota mechanism
        - reliable mechanism (accelerated retries)
        - "trusted" mechanism (adaptive replication)
    - scheduler: enforce host scale probation only for apps with
        host_scale_check set.
    - validator: do scale probation on invalid results
        (need this in addition to error and timeout cases)
    - feeder: update app version scales every 10 min, not 10 sec
    - back-end apps: support --foo as well as -foo for options

    Notes:
    - If you have, say, cuda, cuda23 and cuda_fermi plan classes,
        a host will have separate quotas for each one.
        That means it could error out on 100 jobs for cuda_fermi,
        and when its quota goes to zero,
        error out on 100 jobs for cuda23, etc.
        This is intentional; there may be cases where one version
        works but not the others.
    - host.error_rate and host.max_results_day are deprecated

    TODO:
        - the values in the app table for limits on jobs in progress etc.
            should override rather than config.xml.

    Implementation notes:
    scheduler:
        process_request():
            read all host_app_versions for host at start;
            Compute "reliable" and "trusted" for each one.
            write modified records at end
        get_app_version():
            add "reliable_only" arg; if set, use only reliable versions
            skip over-quota versions
        Multi-pass scheduling: if have at least one reliable version,
            do a pass for jobs that need reliable,
            and use only reliable versions.
            Then clear best_app_versions cache.
        Score-based scheduling: for need-reliable jobs,
            it will pick the fastest version,
            then give a score bonus if that version happens to be reliable.
        When get back a successful result from client:
            increase daily quota
        When get back an error result from client:
            impose scale probation
            decrease daily quota if not aborted
    Validator:
        when handling a WU, create a vector of HOST_APP_VERSION
            parallel to vector of RESULT.
            Pass it to assign_credit_set().
            Make copies of originals so we can update only modified ones
        update HOST_APP_VERSION error rates

    - back end: new way of deciding:
        - whether host is "reliable" for an app version
        - whether host is eligible for single replication for an app version
        - whether to use host scaling
        In each case, the answer is yes if the number of
        consecutive valid results is above a threshold.
        This replaces existing "error rate" and "scale probation" mechanisms.

        TODO: the # of consecutive valid results should also determine
            a limit on jobs in progress for an app version.
            Namely, if N is the threshold for host scaling, the limit should be
                ndevices*(max(1, consecutive_valid - N))
            The client currently doesn't supply enough
            app version info to do this.
            It could be approximated; that would give some protection
            against cherry-picking.
    - credit: more conservative formulas for combining claimed credit
        among replicas.
        If there are normal replicas, we use a "low average"
        that weights each sample by the sum of the other samples.
        Otherwise we use the min (not the average) of the approximate samples.

    - client: fix bug with NVIDIA GPUs.
        Some of them allow only 1 CUDA context at a time.
        You need to create a CUDA context to get available VRAM.
        So the client would run a CUDA job, then immediately kill it.
        Solution:
        - If a GPU app is running,
            let it keep running regardless of available VRAM
            (if it's still running, it has enough VRAM).
        - But don't start new apps if there's not enough available VRAM,
            or it the amount is unknown
            (if the client can't create a CUDA context,
            the app won't be able to either)
    - client: if <coproc_debug> is set, print available GPU RAM periodically

    - client and scheduler RPC:
        Add more info to "project in-progress job list".
        Old: entries included only job name and app plan class;
            this was used to resend lost jobs,
            and to count the # of CPU and GPU jobs.
            But it's not usable e.g. for per-app in-progress limits.
        New: send the client's app versions (including usage info)
            and for each in-progress job, which app version it uses.
            (This reduces request-message size compared with sending
            usage info and app name per job).
    - client and scheduler RPC:
        Add more info to "all in-progress job list", and make it optional.
        This list is used by schedulers that do deadline checks
        using EDF workload simulation.
        Old: the list is always sent, and it contains no info
            about job resource usage
        New: the list is sent only if the scheduler asked for it
            in a previous reply,
            and each entry now contains resource usage (CPU, GPUs)
        Note: the scheduler's EDF simulator is outdated;
            it doesn't know about GPU jobs.
            But we may as well get the info in place.

        You can now specify limits for specific apps,

        Within each of these, you can specify limits on
        CPU jobs, GPU jobs, or total jobs.
        In the case of CPU and GPU limits, you can specify
        whether the limit should be scaled by the number of devices.

        Note: the enforcement of this is done in get_app_version(),
        since per-resource-type limits may dictate what app versions
        we can use for a particular job.

    - back end: change "daily result quota" mechanism.
        Old: config.xml specifies an initial daily quota (say, 100).
            Each host_app_version starts out with this quota.
            On the return of a SUCCESS result,
            the quota is doubled, up to the initial value.
            On the return of an error result, or a timeout,
            the quota is decremented down to 1.
        Problem:
            Doesn't accommodate hosts that can do more than 100 jobs/day.
        New: similar, but
            - on validation of a job, daily quota is incremented.
            - on invalidation of a job, daily quota is decremented.
            - on return of an error result, or a timeout,
                daily quota is min'd with initial quota, then decremented.
        Notes:
            - This allows a host to have an unboundedly large quota
                as long as it continues to return more valid
                than invalid results.
            - Even with this change, hosts that return SUCCESS but
                invalid results will continue to get the initial daily quota.
                It would be desirable to reduce their quota to 1.

        Note: if there are not active tasks on startup,
            and the client makes a work request which doesn't return work,
            it will exit.

    When these flags are used together,
    the client will do 1 job per device and exit.
    This may be useful when running as grid backfill.

        Old: back off until random time in 1st hour of next day

        This is needed to let hosts recover in a reasonable amount of time

    - client: Fix 2 bugs in handling of notices:
        - When client sends all notices instead of starting with the requested
            sequence number (e.g., due to having removed a notice), it must
            prefix the notices with a dummy notice with sequence number -1 to
            tell the manager to clear the notices vector.
        - When parsing RSS feeds, call notices.append() with keep_old false.
            It was passing true, so notices of new posts to threads were not
            having their arrival times updated when additional posts to the
            same thread were reported.

    client/
        cs_notices.cpp

Charlie 29 Jun 2010
    - client: revert my recent change to keep_old argument above.  It caused all
        RSS feeds to be updated repeatedly.  We need to somehow differentiate

        that handle only 1-CPU jobs;
        it disables various mechanisms that prevent multiple clients per host
        (which is normally a bad thing).
        Old:
            - Run the client with a --allow_multiple_clients flag.
                This tells it not to use a mutex that prevents
                multiple clients per host.
            - Run the project with the <multiple_clients_per_host> config flag.
                This suppresses two mechanisms:
                - (avoid duplicate host records)
                    on a scheduler request with no host ID,
                    looks for a host with same domain name, OS type,
                    and mem size, and assumes the request is from that host
                - (job retry)
                    If we get a request that doesn't have a host ID
                    but does have a host CPID,
                    mark its in-progress results as over
                    NOTE: I CAN'T REMEMBER WHY WE SUPPRESS THIS;
                    MARK S, DO YOU REMEMBER?

        Problem:
            if the grid clients attach to a project that
            doesn't use <multiple_clients_per_host>, bad things happen.
            E.g., if there are several requests at about the same time,
            most of them will fail with
            "another RPC already in progress" errors.
            If a project does include this flag,
            it loses protection from duplicate host records.

        New:
            - If the client is run with --allow_multiple_clients flag,
                it passes a <allow_multiple_clients> element
                in scheduler requests.
            - The scheduler skips the duplicate-host check on
                requests that include this flag.
            - There is no more <multiple_clients_per_host> scheduler option.

        Note: if a project using the old mechanism upgrades to this change,
        it will need to use new clients for its grid deployment.

    - scheduler: make some "notice"-priority messages translatable
    - scheduler: add a clause to wu_is_infeasible_custom() for SETI@home:
        don't process VLAR jobs using CUDA apps.
        Note: this is implemented in a slightly non-optimal way.
        If the request asks for both GPU and CPU jobs,
        the scheduler will first decide to use the GPU version.
        It will scan jobs, skipping over VLAR jobs.
        When the GPU request is satisfied, it will switch to the CPU version
        and continue scanning, accepting VLAR jobs.
        But the jobs that were skipped initially won't be rescanned.
        Also, it would be slightly nice to preferentially send
        VLAR jobs to hosts asking for CPU work.
        (This could be done in the scoring function).

    - client/scheduler: fix a group of bugs related to the new mechanism
        where the client tells the scheduler which app versions
        its queued jobs use
        (this is needed, e.g., to enforce per-app or per-resource job limits).
        In this mechanism, the client sends an array of <app_version>s,
        and each <other_result> includes an index into this array.

        - The wrong index was being sent (client).
        - If an <app_version> had a non-existent app name
            (e.g. because that app had been deprecated)
            it wasn't getting put in the array, invalidating array indices
            Furthermore, an erroneous message was being sent to the user

            Fix: if parse error for <app_version>,
            put it in the array anyway, but with cav.app = NULL,
            meaning that it's a place-holder.
            Send a message to user only if anon platform.

    - client: fix a bug that caused GPU apps to fail on startup
        in the following situation.
        Suppose GPU job A is running,
        and GPU job B (which has never run before) preempts it.
        Then
        1) an ACTIVE_TASK and slot dir are allocated for B (slot dir is empty)
        2) A is told to quit; B isn't started until A exits
            (because they're GPU jobs)
        3) before A exits, B is suspended
        4) eventually B is started.
            Its scheduler state is SUSPENDED rather than UNINITIALIZED,
            so the scheduler thinks it slot dir has already been populated.
            But it hasn't, and when the app starts it fails immediately
            because no files are there.

        Fix: decide whether a slot dir needs to be populated by
        seeing whether it's empty,
        rather than looking at the scheduler state of the task.

    - MGR: Further refinements to Client shutdown logic on Manager Exit:
        Old: Manager shut down Client only if it started the Client.
        New:
            Don't show exit dialog if connected Client is not on localhost.
            Mac: Manager shuts down Client only if it started the Client
                and if the Client is on localhost.
            Windows, Linux: Manager shuts down Client, whether or not the
                Manager started the Client, but only if the Client is on
                localhost and the user requests Client shutdown in the exit
                dialog, even if running as a service on Windows.  As before,
                it skips the exit dialog and uses the saved behavior if the
                user previously set "Remember this decision and do not show
                this dialog."

        NOTE: as implemented,

            or domain names of hosts that support only IPv6

    - client simulator: major remodel and upgrade.
        Insteady of using its own XML input files,
        the simulator now takes a client_state.xml file as input.
        The simulator generates a synthetic workload based on the
        projects, apps, app versions, WUs, and result it finds there.

        This means that a user seeing aberrant behavior
        can just send their client_state.xml file
        and (hopefully) we can use the simulator to repro.

        The simulator now can model GPUs.

        As of this checkin, the simulator compiles but doesn't work.
        There should be no change in the actual client.

    - client: fix bug that cause wasted scheduler RPC
        Old: when a job finished, we cleared the backoffs for the
            resources it used.  The idea was to get more jobs
            immediately in the case where the client was at
            a jobs-in-progress limit.
        Problem: this resulted in an RPC immediately,
            typically before the output files were uploaded.
            So the client is still at the limit, and doesn't get jobs.
        New: clear the backoffs at the point when output files
            have been uploaded and the job is ready to report.
    - client: change range in resource backoff from (0,x) to (.5, 1.5*x)

    - scheduler: deal correctly with jobs that need > 2GB RAM.
        Such jobs fail on 32-bit machines, even if they have sufficient RAM,
        because 32-bit OSs don't support address spaces > 2GB.

        In general, we want to support the following scenario:
        - an app has a mixture of small (< 2GB) and big (> 2GB) jobs.
        - there are app versions for both 32b and 64b platforms
        - one of the 32b versions is faster than the 64b version
            (say, it's a 32b GPU app)

        Goals:
        If the client is 32b, send it only small jobs,
            using the fast 32b version if possible
        If the client is 64b and has sufficient RAM,
            send it large jobs using the 64b version;
            send it small jobs using the fast 32b version if possible,
            else the 64b version

        Solution: extend get_app_version() so that it detects big jobs,
            and uses only 64b versions for them.
            Add a "for_64b_jobs" field to BEST_APP_VERSION
            so that we maintain a separate memoized set of
            BEST_APP_VERSIONs for big jobs.

    - MGR(WIN): While it is a perfectly valid thing to use FindWindow() and
        ShowWindow() on an application frame to restore an application from
        a minimized state or a hidden state on Windows(75% of the UI test
        automation would fail at Microsoft without this ability), it appeartly
        isn't for other platforms.  wxWidgets is or appears to be tracking window
        state internally, which leads to problems when the OS restores the window
        and the rest of the framework doesn't know about that change in state.
        Certain window events were being ignored (like WM_CLOSE, menu selection
        events, etc.). So replace the previous mechinism for bringing an existing
        instance of the BOINC Manager to the foreground by creating a new global
        window message which is tracked by the system tray icon.  When the new
        global message is fired make sure the CBOINCGUIApp::SetActiveGUI() function
        is called to restore the window state which in turn updates all the internal
        framework data structures.

    - scheduler: fix logic that deals with jobs that need > 2GB RAM.
        My change of 1 Oct ([22440]) required that such jobs
        be processed with 64-bit apps,
        on the assumption that 32-bit apps have a 2 GB user address space limit.
        However, it turns out this limit applies only to Windows
        (kernel and user mode share the 4GB address space; each gets half).
        On Linux, the split is 3GB user / 1 GB kernel.
        On Mac OS X, user mode and kernel mode have separate address spaces,
        each of them 4 GB.

David  03 Nov 2010
    - client: fix problems with job scheduling policy.
        Old: job scheduling has 2 phases.
            In the first phase (schedule_cpus()) we make a list of jobs,
            with deadline-miss and high-STD jobs first.
            Keep track of the RAM used,
            and skip jobs that would exceed available RAM.
            Stop scanning when the # of CPUs used by jobs in the list
            exceeds the # of actual CPUs.

            In the 2nd phase (enforce_schedule()), we add currently running jobs
            (which may be in the middle of a time slice) to the list,
            and reorder to give priority to such jobs,
            and possibly also to multi-thread jobs.
            We then run and/or preempt jobs, keeping track of RAM used.

        Problems:
            - suppose we add an EDF 1-CPU job to the list, then a MT job.
                We'll stop at that point because #CPUs is exceeded.
                But enforce_schedule() won't run the MT job,
                and CPUs will be idle.
            - Because the list may be reordered, skipping jobs based
                on RAM is not correct, and may cause deadlines to be missed.

        New:
            - when making the job list, keep track of #CPUs used
                by MT jobs and non-MT jobs separately.
                Stop the scan only if the non-MT count exceeds #CPUs.
                This ensures that we have enough jobs to use all the CPUs,
                even if the MT jobs can't be run for whatever reason.
            - don't skip jobs because of RAM usage
            - skip MT jobs if the MT CPU count is at least #CPUs

        Notes:
            - ignoring RAM usage in phase 1 can cause idleness in some cases,
                e.g. suppose there are 4 GB of RAM and the list has
                jobs that use 3 GB, but there are also some jobs that use 1 GB.
                I'm not sure how to fix this.
            - Maybe the 2-phase approach is not a good idea.
                We did it this way for efficiency,
                so that we don't have to recompute the job list
                each time a job checkpoints.
                But this is probably not a concern,
                and I like the idea of a simpler approach,
                e.g. reducing the policy to a single comparison function.

    - python DB layer: fields with values None or ''
        were being omitted from query strings.
        This is incorrect.
        For example, suppose you have an app version with nonempty plan_class,
        then you try to add a version with no plan class.
        The query would omit the "and plan_class = ''"
        so it would match the existing app version and not add a new version.
        Reported by Rytis.
        Hopefully this won't break anything.

    - client: change scheduling policy to allow multithread jobs to coexist
        with GPU jobs that use significant CPU time.
        Old: run a MT job only if total CPU usage will be < #CPUs + 1.
            So if you have some GPU jobs running and their CPU usage sums to < 1,
            BOINC will run a MT job too.
            But if CPU usage > 1 BOINC won't run the MT job,
            and some CPUs will be idle.
        Note: to maximize throughput, it might be better to run
            either GPU jobs or MT jobs, but not both at the same time.
            However, volunteers don't like it when CPUs are idle.  So...
        New: ignore the CPU usage of GPU jobs in deciding whether to run MT jobs.
            So we'll run a 4-core MT job (at low priority)
            even if GPU jobs (which run at normal priority) use > 1 CPU.

        The round-robin simulation wasn't handling multithread jobs correctly.
        For example, given two 3-CPU jobs,
        it would model running them together on a 4-CPU host.
        This doesn't correspond with the CPU scheduler,
        which runs only 1 at a time.
        So the simulator would say that there are no idle CPUs
        when in fact there are, and no new CPU jobs would be fetched.

        Solution: if J is an unstarted job,

            consider J's working set size to be the largest of
            the working sets of those jobs.

        Note: this may result in idleness in some cases.
    - scheduler: if client doesn't handle plan class (pre-5.10),
        check plan-class app versions anyway,
        but only use if it's a single-CPU app.
        This allows single-CPU app versions with specific requirements
        (like SSE) to be issued to old clients.

    - client: if detect that system clock has been set backwards
        (either at startup or during execution)
        reset a number of "wait until X" variables;
        otherwise we might wait years to contact a project, restart a file xfer, etc.
        Notes:
        - there is no problem setting clocks forward; things just happen prematurely
        - some variables (e.g. task deadlines) are not reset,
            because it's not clear what to set them to
    - sched: remove ati_opencl plan class until we understand what it is

	- client: improve text of "message from server" notices
	- manager: change "add account manager" to "use account manager".
		"Add" is confusing, because you can't add multiple account managers
		like you add projects.
	- client: recognize a few new ATI GPU models
		from [P3D] Crashtest
