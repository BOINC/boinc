    - client: fix job scheduling bug.
        Scenario: we have 2 CPUs and 1GB RAM
        Project A has jobs that use 1GB.
        Project B has small-mem jobs.
        Currently, we ignore RAM usage in building the runnable job list,
        so we might pick 2 jobs from project A.
        enforce_schedule() (which checks RAM usage) will run just one of them,
        and the other CPU will be idle.
        Solution: keep track of RAM usage while building the runnable job list.

    - client: eliminate unnecessary CPU reschedules.
        Currently we do a reschedule any time a job checkpoints,
        in case there's a job that has finished a time slice
        but hasn't checkpointed yet.
        Instead: flag such jobs, and trigger a reschedule
        on checkpoint only for flagged jobs.
    - client: fix instability in job scheduling that happens
        if a job's estimated completion time in RR sim is close to its deadline.
        It can alternate between making and missing deadline,
        causing the scheduler to alternate rapidly between jobs.
        Solution: if RR sim has marked a job as deadline miss
        any time in the last (CPU scheduling period),
        treat it as a deadline miss.

        to be skipped in RR simulation,
        and therefore to not be counted in the work buffer.

    - scheduler: fix a problem with job resend.
        When we first send a job, we pick an app version,
        then call wu_is_infeasible_fast()
        to see if the host is able to run the job with that app version.
        In addition to checking disk space etc.
        this calls wu_is_infeasible_custom() to do project-specific checks
        (e.g. for SETI@home: don't use GPUs for VLAR jobs).

        However, when we resend a job, we pick an app version
        (possibly different from the original one)
        and send the job without any checking.
        So, for example, we might send a VLAR job to a GPU,
        or send a job to a host with insufficient disk space
        (because free space has changed since original send).

        Solution: call wu_is_infeasible_fast() before resending a job,
        and if it returns true, mark the job as done and don't resend it.

        and results in an overestimation of saturated time.

        Old: at the start of simulation, call WORK_FETCH::compute_shares() 
            to get resources of runnable projects.
            Use these throughout the simulation.

        Problem: suppose you have 2 runnable projects;
            P1 has large RS, P2 has small RS.
            P1's jobs finish quickly.
            P2's jobs then are running alone,
            but their FLOPS is scaled (incorrectly) by P2's small RS.

        Solution: recompute relative CPU resource share within the
            simulation loop,
            and compute it over the projects that have actives jobs
            in the simulation.

    - scheduler: if we're not sending jobs because of user prefs

        send a message, not a notice.
        Assume the user knew what they were doing,
        and doesn't want to be nagged.
    - scheduler: check for the existence of an app version
        before checking for user selected-app prefs.
        This prevents sending "no jobs available for selected apps"
        message when no app versions exist for non-selected apps

    - client: generalize the GPU framework so that

        - users can specify GPUs in cc_config.xml,
            referred to by app_info.xml,
            and they will be scheduled by BOINC
            and passed --device N options
            Note: the parsing of cc_config.xml is not done yet.
        - RPC protocols (account manager and scheduler)
            can now specify GPU types in separate elements
            rather than embedding them in tag names
            e.g. <no_rsc>NVIDIA</no_rsc> rather than <no_cuda/>
    - client: in account manager replies, parse elements of the form
        <no_rsc>NAME</no_rsc>
        indicating the GPUs of type NAME should not be used.
        This allows account managers to control GPU types
        not hardwired into the client.
        Note: <no_cuda/> and <no_ati/> will continue to be supported.
    - scheduler RPC reply: add
        <no_rsc_apps>NAME</no_rsc_apps>
        (NAME = GPU name)
        to indicate that the project has no jobs for the indicated GPU type.
        <no_cuda_apps> etc. are still supported 
    - client/lib: remove set_debts() GUI RPC
    - client/scheduler RPC
        remove <cuda_backoff> etc. (superceded by no_app)
        Exception: <ip_result> elements in sched request
        still have <ncudas> and <natis>.
        Fix this later.

    Implementation notes:
    - client/lib: change "CUDA" to "NVIDIA" in type/variable names, and in XML
        Continue to recognize "CUDA" for compatibility
    - host_info.coprocs no longer used within the client;
        use a global var (COPROCS coprocs) instead.
        COPROCS now has an array of COPROCs;
        GPUs types are identified by the array index.
        Index zero means CPU.
    - a bunch of other resource-specific structs (like RSC_WORK_FETCH)
        are now stored in arrays, with same indices as COPROCS
        (i.e. index 0 is CPU)
    - COPROCS still has COPROC_NVIDIA and COPROC_ATI structs to hold vendor-specific info
    - APP_VERSION now has a struct GPU_USAGE to describe its GPU usage

    - WINSCR: So after looking over all the logs from WCG and now from Jacob
        Klein a pattern started to emerge.  At the end of the log files the last
        message logged was 0x12 which translates into WM_QUIT.  The latest
        documentation on WM_QUIT states it should never show up in the message
        loop to begin with.
        
        The docs now say that WM_QUIT should not be sent to the message loop by
        way of PostMessage.  We have been doing things this way for over 5 years.
        
        Change the shutdown logic so that only the primary curtain window can call
        PostQuitMessage() and all other curtain windows just exit when they receive
        a WM_DESTROY message.
        
        I'm not sure what causes this to be a problem on some machines and not
        others.  But preliminary results from Jacob are encouraging.

        Multiprocess apps must initialize with something like:
            BOINC_OPTIONS options;
            boinc_options_defaults(options);
            options.multi_process = true;
            boinc_init_options(&options);
        Note: an application can be both multi-thread and multi-process.
        In this case set options.multi_thread as well.
    - wrapper: add support for multi-process apps.
        Previously, suspend/resume operations did not work for subprocesses.
        If a task is multi-process, you must include

        - We maintain the most recent fraction_done in state file.
            But for apps that checkpoint seldom or never,
            this is not the relevant value,
            and frac done may go down when the app runs.
        - fraction_done_elapsed_time is not initialized,
            and can have garbage values for jobs that haven't run yet.
        New:
        - Record, in the state file, the values of
            fraction_done and fraction_done_elapsed_time
            at the most recent checkpoint.

    - client: change the handling of account manager replies:
        Old:
            If the AM sends us a project we're already attached to,
            and the authenticator is different,
            print an error message and don't change anything.
        Problem:
            If the AM is using weak authenticators,
            and the user has changed their password,
            the weak authenticator changes.
            In this case the AM will send the new weak auth,
            the client will ignore it,
            and all subsequent scheduler RPCs will fail
            until the user removes/adds the project.
        Solution:
            If the AM sends us a new auth for a project, use it.
        Note:
            From the time the password is changed on the project
            to the next AM RPC,
            the client will have a bad weak auth and scheduler RPCs will fail.
            That's OK.

    - Change the way update_versions works, and reimplement it in PHP.
        Problems with the old version:
        - Lots of info encoded in file and directory names: messy kludge
        - The convention that directory name == main program name
            created a bad situation when using the wrapper:
            if you made a new version of your application,
            you were forced make a new version of the wrapper
            just so it could have a different name.
        The new version is described here:

        Lets you specify, on a per-app basis,
        that all instances should be done using the same app version.
        This is for validation in the presence of GPUs.
    - scheduler: code cleanup
        - Instead of adding a bunch of non-DB fields to RESULT,
            used a derived class SCHED_DB_RESULT.
        - Instead of storing a pointer to BEST_APP_VERSION in RESULT,
            store the structure itself.
            This simplifies the memory allocation situation.

#else  // Linux or other probably have their own safe exit handling, defined as

and install at the top of the cffft loop, and more locations if desired:
 SAFE_EXIT_CHECK;

I'd like to implement these as BOINC API functions, but have not yet done so.

    - client: we were assuming that if we ask a task to exit
        and its main process exits, everything is OK.
        That's not necessarily the case - buggy apps may have
        subprocesses that the main process fails to kill.

        Solution: when we request a task to exit or abort,
        make a list of the descendants.
        When the main process exits, kill any remaining descendants.
        
        Also: we weren't checking for the ABORT_PENDING case
        in the process exit logic.
        This may explain the 5/15 second delay in detaching or
        resetting a project with running tasks

    - MGR: It turns out we want the Wizard ProjectInfo Page to check for ATI and NVIDIA 
        GPUs regardless of whether they were reported by CAL, CUDA or OpenCL, so we can 
        just check CC_STATE::have_ati and CC_STATE::have_nvidia even for newer clients.  
        This means the Manager doesn't need to do get_host_info RPCs, because all the 
        host info it needs is available from the host_info section of the get_state RPC, 
        so eliminate the unnecessary Manager calls of get_host_info RPC.

    - scheduler: fix nasty bug where SCHED_DB_RESULT::parse()
        was doing memset(this, 0, sizeof(RESULT)),
        i.e. it wasn't zeroing out the whole structure.
        The elapsed_time field (which isn't reported by old clients),
        is near the end of the struct,
        and it was getting garbage, e.g. 1e-304, in some cases,
        which led to zero credit (and maybe other problems)
    - validator: treat 1e-304 like zero in case of other problems

        Add parsed_tag and is_tag to the class,
        so that parsing functions don't need to declare them
        and pass them around.
    - Complete the task of using XML_PARSER as the argument
        to all parsing functions.
        (Internally, many of these functions still use the old XML parser;
        that's the next step.)

    - Vbox wrapper: deal with checkpointing.
        Current: wrapper reports frequent checkpointing to client,
            but actually checkpoints only when the VM is stopped
        Problem: large amounts of work would be wasted if
            BOINC stops in an ungraceful way (e.g., power failure)
        Solution:
            Don't report frequent checkpointing.
            Every CPU scheduling period (typically once/hour)
            stop the VM (creating a checkpoint)
            and call boinc_temporary_exit(0).
            If the client wants to keep running this job,
            it will start us immediately.

David  2 Sept 2011
    - client/API/vboxwrapper:
        add a mechanism so that apps can report sub-processes
        that are not descendants (e.g., virtual machines)
        These processes are then counted as part of the app,
        not as "non-BOINC CPU time".
        This fixes a bug where processing was incorrectly suspended
        because CPU usage by VM apps exceeded the "CPU usage limit" pref.

        Implementation:
        - the PIDs of the processes in question
            are passed from app to client via shared-memory,
            in the app_status channel.
            A new variant of boinc_report_app_status() supports this.
        - the VBox wrapper queries the PID of the VM,
            and reports it in this way.
        - procinfo_app() includes a new argument: a list of PIDs
            that are part of the app, although not ancestrally
            related to the main process.
        - in the client, ACTIVE_TASK now includes a vector "other_pids".
            If this is nonempty, it's passed to procinfo_app().

    - Validator: allow project-specific code to mark a result
        is a "runtime outlier", i.e. its runtime does
        not correspond to the job's rsc_fpops_est.
        Runtime outliers are not counted in the statistics for
        elapsed time, turnaround time, and peak FLOPs count.

        The is intended for applications like SETI@home,
        some of whose jobs finish more or less instantly
        (this happens if the data contains a lot of interference).
        If a host happens to get a bunch of these short jobs,
        its statistics will get skewed: in essence, the server
        will think that the host is extremely fast,
        and will send it too many jobs.

    - client: fix a bug reported by Jacob Klein,
        where work fetch didn't work right in the presence of
        multiple GPUs and <exclude_gpu> config options.
        For example: suppose:
            - you have 2 GPUs and 2 projects
            - Project A is excluded from GPU 1
            - you have lots of jobs for project A
        Then the client won't try to fetch jobs from project B.

        The problem had 2 parts:
        a) round-robin simulation wasn't taking GPU exclusions into account.
            In the above example, it would think that both GPUs had jobs.
            I fixed this by computing the # of GPUs from each project
            is excluded, and using this in the RR simulation.
        b) Once this was done, I needed to make the client
            request GPU jobs from project B rather than project A.
            I did this with following policy:
            If a project has excluded GPUs of a given type,
            and has a runnable job of that type,
            don't ask it for more work of that type.

        Notes:
        - the policy in b) is crude, and it means that work-buffer
            preferences are ignored in some cases.
        - neither a) nor b) takes into account app-level exclusions.

        I could fix both of these with a lot of work,
        but I'd rather move to a model in which dissimilar GPUs
        are modeled as different resources,
        which would remove the need for the <exclude_gpu> mechanism
        in the first place.

        Other note: I figured out this problem using the client simulator,
        based on the client state file that Jacob sent me.

    - client: fix bug that could cause GPU idleness
        in the presence of GPU exclusions.
        The problem was in the job-selection phase,
        which picks enough jobs to use all devices.
        It was ignoring GPU exclusions, so for example on
        a 2 GPU system it could pick 2 jobs from a project
        for which 1 GPU is excluded,
        and as a result 1 GPU would be idle.

        Solution: during job selection,
        keep track of GPU usage on a per-instance basis.
        Select a job only if it can run on a non-excluded GPU.

    - scheduler: fix a bug that would choose app versions erroneously.
        The problem: the choice of app version was based on
        the "projected FLOPS" return by estimate_flops(av).
        If usage stats exist for the host / app version,
        this returns a number X such that
        WU.rsc_fpops_est/X approximates the runtime of a job
        using the given app version..
        (If WU.rsc_fpops_est is way off, this will be correspondingly way off
        from the actual FLOPS the app version will get.)
        However, if there are no usage stats,
        it return an estimate based on host hardware speed,
        which might be 100X less.
        Hence, in some cases a new app version would never get used.

        Solution: choose app versions based on the values
        returned by the app plan functions.
        Use estimate_flops() AFTER choosing the version.
    - scheduler: improve the accuracy of FLOPS estimation for GPU apps.
        The "flops_scale" argument to coproc_perf
        (which expresses the difference between peak GPU FLOPS
        and actual FLOPS) should be used to scale GPU FLOPS
        prior to calling coproc_perf(),
        rather than scaling the estimate returned by coproc_perf().

    - client: improvements to job scheduling and work fetch policies.
        - Job scheduling: the baseline policy is to schedule based on "project priority",
            which is how much processing P should receive based on resource share
            minus how much it actually has received recently.
            This policy tends to run jobs from the same project together,
            so we modified it by adding a priority adjustment as jobs are scheduled.
            The idea is that if 2 projects have about the same priority
            they should split the processors.

            The problem: the adjustment was too large on hosts that are on
            only a small fraction of the time,
            thus tending to run 1 job from each project, regardless of priority.

            Solution: make an adjustment that reflects the host's actual throughput.
            See adjust_rec_sched() for details.

        - Work fetch: similar situation.
            We were making an adjustment based on how much work the project currently has queued,
            but the adjustment drowned out the project priority,
            so we'd tend to always get work from the project that has least work queued.
            Solution: make a smaller adjustment (-.3 ... .3)

    - scheduler: fix bug in the "homogeneous app version" (HAV) feature
        (reported by Kevin Reed).
        The problem: cache inconsistency.
        If there are 2 results for the same WU in shared mem,
        and 2 scheduler instances get them around the same time,
        they can send them with different app versions.
        We already fixed this problem for HR by
        1) rereading the relevant WU fields while deciding
            whether to send the result
        2) doing a "careful update" of the WU field using a where clause
            to make sure it wasn't modified in the (short) interval
            since rereading it.
        I fixed the HAV problem in the same way,
        and merged the two mechanisms to combine the DB queries.

        Also:
        - The rereads are done in slow_check() (see below).
        - The careful updates are done in update_wu_on_send(),
            and this is called *before* doing careful updates on result fields.
            That way, if the WU updates fail, we don't have orphaned results.
        - already_sent_to_different_platform_careful() (sic)
            no longer does DB stuff, so it's merged with
            already_send_to_different_hr_class() (better name)

        NOTE: slow_check() is used in array scheduling only.
            Score-based scheduling uses other code,
            in which this bug is not yet fixed.
            Locality scheduling doesn't support HR or HAV at all.
            This should be unified.

        - the one that's part of wu_result (in the shared-mem array)
        - a temp copy.
            quick_check() may modify this in host-specific ways
            (e.g., adjusting rsc_fpops_est or delay_bound).
            This is the one we pass to add_result_to_reply().

        update both structs.

    - Mgr: Exit manager as soon as quit rpc to client succeeds, instead 
        of waiting for client to exit.
        (Checked in to 6.13.10 for Mac build only.)
        
        The problem: if suspended tasks are kept in memory, some project 
        applications don't respond to exit request from client, but client 
        needs to allow 20 seconds before killing them in case they are 
        writing a large checkpoint file.  But if the manager waits that 
        long to exit, it seems unresponsive to users, so it was killing 
        the client after only 10 seconds. This left orphan project apps 
        in RAM.
        
        The solution: assume that if the quit rpc to the client succeeds, 
        the client will exit properly, so kill client only if RPC fails 
        or is not completed in 10 seconds.

            the field back to zero;

        VboxSVC.exe is normally launched by svchost.exe which only contains environment
        variables defined by the system.  In the BOINC sandbox environment we want to
        add VBOX_USER_HOME to redirect reading/writing configuration files to a
        different directory.  What happens if we launch it ahead of making any calls to
        VBoxManage which would cause the OS to launch it?  If we launch it, it should
        inherit our environment block and work just like it works on Linux and the Mac.

        for the job would have prevented the CC from rescheduling the job and removing
        it from memory.  Now it can so the extra shutdown each scheduling period
        should not be needed.

    - VBOX: Remove attempts to remove the floppy image from the media registry.
        Apparently when the VM is removed from the VirtualBox server process
        it automatically deletes the floppy image from the media registry.
    - VBOX: If a VM crashes for one reason or another, append the VM execution
        log file to the stderr.txt file.  I believe this is what is going on with
        Richard Mitnick's computer.  At the very least we should be able to give
        this to the VirtualBox guys.
    - VBOX: Introduce a way to re-execute commands when a session lock
        event is detected.  A session lock event happens when a volunteer is
