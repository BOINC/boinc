    - Deprecated the bad hash function used for the
        upload/download directory hierarchies.
        It wasn't uniform.
        Use MD5 instead.

        Kept the old one around for a the time being.
        dir_hier_path() and dir_hier_url() take a new arg
        saying whether to use new or old hash.
        The file_deleter and validator try the new hash, then the old.

        rows were being calculated
    - Bug Fix: Remove the explict call to freeze/thaw which was causing

    - Bug Fix: The new gui should enforce closing down the core client
        when it launches the core client, we were using the wxWidget
        framework to do this, but the call to wxProcess::Exists causes
        an assert on Windows if the process doesn't exist.  And sometimes
        crashes in a release build.
    - Bug Fix: When syncing the views cache make sure there is at least
        one item to syncronize, otherwise we'll reference a NULL pointer
        and blow up.  This fixes the crashing bug when you startup and
        shutdown the core client in the background.

      boinc_finish() remove the lockfile

      graphics-eventloop: some re-structuring and simplification to

Bruce 8 Jan 2005

    In order to coordinate better with David, I am doing a slightly
    premature checkin of modifications to scheduling locality.  The
    basic idea is to provide a simple notification mechanism to the
    project, so that if no work is currently available for a given
    data file, there is an opportunity to make such work.  This is
    controlled by an additional tag in config.xml, of the form:

    <locality_scheduling_wait_period> N </locality_scheduling_wait_period>

    where N is some number of seconds.  If this new tag is absent,
    then the locality scheduler behaves as before.

    The modification to behavior happens in send_results_for_file().
    This is the function that queries the database to see if there are
    unsent results available for a given (large) data file on the
    host.  Previously, if such results are not found the scheduler
    gives up and tries sending other results.  With this modification,
    if N is nonzero, then if no results are found the scheduler
    touches a file with the same name as the host's data file, in a
    directory
       PROJECT_ROOT/locality_scheduling/need_work/
    The scheduler then sleeps for N seconds, and makes one additional
    attempt to find suitable unsent results. The idea is that in this
    interval, the project has an opportunity to make additional WU for
    this file, which the transitioner can convert to unsent
    results. [Note, the transaction for the first query is completed
    before the sleep(N), and a new transaction is initiated
    afterwards. So there is no 'sleep within a transaction'.] This
    delay allows the project to make additional workunits suitable for
    the host's existing data files.

    In addition, if the project determines that NO further workunits
    can be made for a given data file, then the project can touch a
    file with the same name as the input data file, in a directory
          PROJECT_ROOT/locality_scheduling/no_work_available/
    If the scheduler finds this warning then it assumes that the
    project can not manufacture additional WU for this data file and
    skips the 'notify, sleep, query again' sequence above.  Of course
    it still does the initial query, so if the transitioner has made
    some new results for an existing (old) WU, they will get picked
    up.

    This mechanism is robust in the sense that if the signals fail for
    any reason, or (say) the WU are not converted into unsent results
    quickly enough by the transitioner, or if they are snapped up by
    some other host, then the scheduler simply proceeds as with its
    current unmodified behavior and nothing goes wrong.  In other
    words, the signals can be ignored at any time and for any time
    without adverse consequences.

    TODO: further testing.

David  8 Jan 2005
    Some changes related to locality scheduling:

    - Factored Bruce's new code into a separate function,
        make_more_work_for_file()
    - Remove the 'id>X' stuff from queries.
        Assuming that work is fairly homogeneous
        (i.e. no results are rejected because of resource requirements)
        this is not needed.
        If a result has already been sent,
        it won't qualify for the select anyway.
    - Add a 'workunitid<>X' clause to the queries.
        This is to make the process of enforcing the
        one_result_per_wu_per_user rule more efficient.
        If the rule is not in effect, X is zero (so always true)
    - If two consecutive select queries return the same result,
        break out of the loop (avoid undesired looping)
    - Use a for i=1,100 loop instead of a while(1) loop
        around the work-sending logic,
        to avoid infinite loops just in case

    sched/
        sched_locality.C

David  8 Jan 2005
    - Implement the <locality_scheduling_wait_period> element in config.xml
        If present, this tells the scheduler how long to sleep
        between requesting more work for a file
        and looking for it (and giving up if it's not there)
        If absent, the scheduler doesn't request more work unit generation.

David  10 Jan 2005
    - locality scheduling changes:
        Changed the algorithms a bit to avoid lots of DB queries
        Invariant: for a given file/user pair,
            results are sent in order of increasing ID
            (i.e. the result sent is that with the smallest ID
            among all those that CAN be sent).
            This ensures that:
            - the result for given WU will be sent around the same time
        send_results_for_file():
            1) of results for this file sent to this user,
                find the one R with largest ID
            2) find unsent result R2 for this file with next ID greater than R,
                and (if one result per user per WU) different workunitid than
                ALL previous results sent to this user.
            3) if need more results, set R = R2 and go to 2)
        send_new_file_work():
            min_id = 0
            while need more work
                find unsent result R with id>min_id of least ID
                min_id = R.id
            (Note: this is necessary to preserve the invariant)
        Changed make_more_work_for_file() to return zero for success
            (BOINC convention)

    more locality sched changes (with Bruce Allen)

    - Added a notion of "working set" of files.
        If a host doesn't have a file, the scheduler picks a
        random entry from the working set and tries to send it
        work from that file.
        The project must supply a daemon program that maintains the working set
        (could be the same as the work generator)
    - Added config.locality_scheduling_send_timeout.
        If any unsent result is older than this,
        send it to the first eligible host
    - If a host already has files, randomize their order
    - Integrate work-generator invocation in send_results_for_file()
    - If can't send a result because of no app_version, give up

    more locality sched changes.
    - bug fix 1, trivial, n % 0  generates FPE if no files.
    - bug fix 2, subtle.  In the deterministic hunt to find
      the next unsent result, the comparison of the result name must be
      done with the lexically maximum result name constructed from the
      given filename.  Eg, if one needs name>FILE_ZZZZ...Z where
      Z=0xff (is this charset independent??) and the total name length
      is 255 (or is it 254??).

    - David, I'll clean out some of the debugging scaffolding in a few
      more days, when I get some confidence that there are not other
      problems to fix!  Please read embedded comments/questions in code.

    - Some more comemnts added later.  We do sometimes get non-zero
      return values from possibly_send_result().  I think that this is
      because you've failed to match up the start_transaction and
      commit_transaction pairs.  Be careful: sleeps AND modifies the
      DB.  Right now I am too tired to fix this without making it worse.
      Your turn.

    - A few other comments.  Currently, I am 'advertising' filenames
      returned by get_working_set_filename() for TWO types of files:
      (1) those for which I can make more work
      (2) those for which I can NOT make more work, but where you have
          not flagged with flag_for_possible_removal().
      I am not sure that I understand the intent of
      flag_for_possible_removal().  You surely are not guaranteeing
      that no results will ever appear in the future for these files
      (outstanding results might fail).  So what is my WU generator
      supposed to do with flag_for_possible_removal?  Is (2) above
      correct? 

     - Finally, I have not yet seen a SINGLE instance of a
       flag_for_possible_removal.  Is the logic right?

Bruce  13 Jan 2005
    - Various efforts to fix CVS 'loginfo' file so that we get auto
      mailings of changes to the top level directory.  The main problem
      is that one can't use "^boinc[ ]" or "^boinc\ " or
      "^boinc\#20" as a regex to try and match the name of the top
      level directory with no trailing slash. What a mess! 

    - More work on sched_locality.C.  Note that the 'wacky' warning is
      actually not impossible.  Consider the following scenario: WU A
      has result 1 and WU B has result 2.  These are both sent to a
      host.  Some time later, result 1 fails and the transitioner
      creates a new result, result 3 for WU A.  Then the host requests
      a new result.  The maximum result already sent to the host is 2.
      The next unsent result (sorted by ID) is #3.  But since it is
      for WU A, and since the host has already gotten a result for WU
      A, it's infeasible.  So I think this is only wacky if
      !one_wu_per_result_per_host.

    - David, I simplified the inner part of send_results_for_file()
      somewhat.  I can't see the need/use for the bool bool
      in_working_set argument.  If I have really screwed the pooch
      please revert.

    - Core client: when get a workunit from scheduler,
        clear errors (e.g. download failures)
        for all files associated with this WU
        (this is down in a new function WORKUNIT::clear_errors())
        Without this, if a file common to multiple WUs had a download
        failure, all WUs would fail until user resets project!!
    - Giant bug in HTTP file transfer:
        If a network connection failed in the middle,
        it wasn't being distinguished from a completed download;
        the file size would be checked at the PERS_FILE_XFER level,
        and it would get a "bad file size" fatal error.
        Fix: when get EOF from a network connection reading HTTP reply,
        compare the bytes transferred with the content-length
        from HTTP header.
        If not equal, classify it as an error.
        This will cause higher levels to view it as a transient error,
        and restart the download later.
    - PERS_FILE_XFER::poll():
        the check for actual file size == desired file size
        was inexplicably being done even for file uploads,
        and even in cases where another error had occurred.
        Do it only for download success cases.

    - modified DB_BASE::enumerate() so that it returns:
        - zero if returning a row
        - ERR_DB_NOT_FOUND if reached end of result set
        - other values indicated DB errors (e.g. lost connection to server)

        Strange as it may seem, until now we didn't have a way of
        knowing that enumerate() had errored out.
        As a result, e.g., db_dump would happily generate
        a zero-entry user or host file
        if the DB happened to disconnect during the select.
    - changed db_dump.C to check error returns from enumerate(),
        and exit() on DB failure
    - changed xml_escape() to completely remove
        control characters except for 9, 10, 13

    - Additional work on locality scheduling.  
        (a) make DB queries more efficient using name>'FILE__' and
            name<'FILE__~' rather than name like 'FILE__%'
      (b) Set 'no remaining work for this file' flag correctly
          by making a DB scan if needed.
          One can show that this is the 'cheapest'
          reliable place to put this scan.
      (c) Modify deterministic algorithm for finding unsent results
          so that instead of starting with FILE="" and scanning forward
          over all files, it starts at a random place in file space,
          scans cyclicly to the end, and then from "" to the start point.
      (d) Satisfy work request if possible.
          Don't terminate sending work until none left that is feasible,
          or request satisfed.
      (e) If a new file is needed, first pick file associated with unsent
          results which are more than 2 hours old.
          Note: need to make this a user-configurable option,
          and add some random +- slack.
      
       For the record, here is the current locality scheduler logic.
       I will update the docs once this is a bit better tested and
       stable.

      (1) If there is an (one) unsent result which is older than
      (1) config.locality_scheduling_send_timeout (7 days) and is
      (1) feasible for the host, sent it.
 
      (2) If we did send a result in the previous step, then send any
      (2) additional results that are feasible for the same input file.
 
      (3) If additional results are needed, step through input files on
      (3) the host.  For each, if there are results that are feasible for
      (3) the host, send them.  If there are no results that are feasible
      (3) for the host, delete the input file from the host.
 
      (4) If additional results are needed, and there is (one) unsent
      (4) result which is older than 2 hours and is feasible for the
      (4) host, send it.

      (5) If we did send a result in the previous step, then send any
      (5) additional results that are feasible for the same input file.
 
      (6) If additional results are needed, select an input file name at
      (6) random from the current input file working set advertised by
      (6) the WU generator.  If there are results for this input file
      (6) that are feasible for this host, send them.
 
      (7) If additional results are needed, carry out an expensive,
      (7) deterministic search for ANY results that are feasible for the
      (7) host.  This search starts from a random filename advertised by
      (7) the WU generator, but continues cyclicly to cover ALL results
      (7) for ALL files. If a feasible result is found, send it.  Then
      (7) send any additional results that use the same input file.  If
      (7) there are no feasible results for the host, we are finished:
      (7) exit.

      (8) If addtional results are needed, return to step 4 above.

    - Initial test-version of the moderation system
      Please test the current features (deleting posts, moving posts) and see 
      if this is how it should be done.
      The rest is mostly copy-paste work as the same design can be used for
      threads as well.

      This update includes:
           - Deleting posts
           - Moving posts
           - Sending email notice to post author
           - Users cannot edit their posts more than 1 hour after creating them
           - Deleted posts are only shown to moderators
           - Inversion of $filter_on in getThreads and getPosts (!)
             Now the bit means "show deleted posts/threads" and defaults to off
           - New special user bitfield

      Due to the new special user bitfield you must redefine who is who in your
      project. Currently this is done manually (idea for the ops page, anyone?)

      This is how the bitfield is used:
           1st bit = Moderator
           2nd bit = Project Admin
           3rd bit = Project dev
           4th bit = Project tester
           5th bit = Volunteer dev
           6th bit = Volunteer tester
           7th bit = Project Scientist
           
           So if I'm a project admin and want to be moderator as well, I would
           do the following SQL query:
           
           Update forum_preferences set special_user = '1100000' where userid=42

          a new function boinc_exit() and call that instead.
      (2) improvements to GUI build with wxWidgets

          is taken away when window killed.

    - From Reinhard Prix.  At Rom's request, this builds the
      Linux client and clientgui using static rather than

      Linux) might be desirable.

David  20 Jan 2005
    - Added cross-project IDs for hosts.
        This lets statistics sites show work per host, summed over projects.

        Implementation:
        Hosts generate their own "internal" CPIDs,
        using an MD5 of time/domain/IP/disk_free.
        This should be unique across that user's hosts.
        It's stored in the HOST_INFO structure and sent to server.
        The server hashes the internal CPID with the user's email address
        and stores the resulting "external" CPID in the host table.
        It is included by db_dump in <host> elements.

    PROJECT NOTE: if you use this server code you will need
    to apply update_1_20_2005() from html/ops/db_update.php to existing DBs

Rom    20 Jan 2005
    - Bug Fix: Remove some code that was keeping half of the
        check_suspend_activities conditions to be skipped.

      NOTE: basically this was causing BOINC to alternate
        between suspended mode and non-suspended mode twice
        a second because the check for user idle activity
        happened after we returned from the function which
        means that reason was returning 0, meaning we shouldn't
        be suspended.

    - Bug Fix: Setting activities_suspended should happen outside
        the check for tasks_restarted, since it is used later in
        the function, and activities_suspended may not be what
        we expect it to be.
    - Cleanup: In the idle detection routine save the needed values
        to a variable so we can see them as we are steping though
        the code, let the optimizer deal with it on release builds.
    - Bug Fix: Remove the Modify option in setup, our setup is an
        all or nothing deal.
    - Bug Fix: Configure setup for automatic upgrades, this requires
        the previous MSI databases from the builds we release to
        public.

      NOTE: I need to talk to David about this a little bit, but
        I think it is doable.
    - Bug Fix: Fix the screensaver load up problem where it was
        taking 60 seconds before the first text was displayed.

      NOTE: This reintroduces a bug where the screensaver slows to
        a crawl when boinc isn't running in the background.  I
        think I've figured out a solution to it, but I didn't get
        the code written for this release.

    - make_work: fixed a basic design problem.
        Its main loop creates workunits until the number of
        sendable results reaches the "cushion" level.
        This worked OK in the old days when creating a workunit
        created its results; but these days the transitioner does that.
        So make_work would end up creating way more workunits
        than it's supposed to.

        The fix: estimate how many WUs to create
        (based on wu.target_nresults).
        Make that many, then sleep for 10 seconds
        (give the transitioner a chance to create the results).

    - Another problem: the "master WU" used by make_work could
        get deleted by file_deleter and db_purge.
        Kludgy but effective solution:
        change file_deleter and db_purge to ignore WUs whose
        name includes "nodelete".
        Call your master WU "wu_nodelete".

    - change dir_hier_path so that it just prints the pathname of the file,
        so you can use it in scripts

    - scheduler changes: if host is not getting any work because available
      disk space is < 0, delete files which have <sticky> and <report_on_rpc>
      set.  Note that (1) this deletion simply removes the <sticky> tag, so
      file won't be deleted until after all WU that depend upon it are
      completed and (2) the mechanism to determine which file to delete
      could be improved. TODO: improve messages to hosts which have no file
      space and ALSO have no files to delete.
    - scheduler changes: locality scheduling.  Clean up code which makes a
      deterministic search of results to delete.  Data files names can not
      contain the "~" character!
    - modified the send_new_file_work() function to look for unsent work
      starting with a random time 6 to 12 hours ago.
    - scheduler changes: added a simple debugging mechanism for scheduler
      requests/replies.  If you touch a file named 'debug_sched' in the project
      root, then files called sched_reply_HOSTID_RPCNO and
      sched_request_HOSTID_RPCNO will be created
      under cgi-bin/ which contain the scheduler replies.  You can turn on
      this mechanism for some time to study the scheduler replies.
    - David, the write() function that I added to SCHEDULER_REQUEST can
      probably be done better.  It would be nice if all the classes that
      this includes an instance of had their own write() functions: it
      would make debugging very easy.

    - Added functions to read and parse .po translations for the webinterface.
    - Changed apps.php to use these new functions as an example.
    - Added a tiny example language interface file
    - Added language files (that are valid with regards to the interface) for
      English and Danish as an example

      The script (Apache or whatever webserver is used) must have write-
      access to the /languages/compiled directory as well as /languages/. It 
      will create compiled versions of the interface file and language files the
      first time a page is accessed after a new language file or interface file
      has been installed.

      To output something that can be translated, a page can use:
      echo tr(MY_TOKEN);
      where MY_TOKEN is the token-name used to identify the text that will be
      output. To actually be allowed to write and use MY_TOKEN, the token must
      be added to the language interface. The language interface file is simply
      a file containing all the valid tokens listed one per line. Adding
      MY_TOKEN
      to the bottom of the file will make "MY_TOKEN" a valid token.

      Whenever you add a new token to the interface you _should_ at least add
      the text to the english language file located in 
      /languages/translations/en.po
      This file is used as default language and will be used as fallback in case
      a translator for another language does not provide a translation for your
      particular token (which especially will be the case when you add a new
      token).

      You should be able to add comments using a # as the first char in a line - 
      at least in the .po-files.

      Future plans: 1) An expansion for project specific translations which can 
      be independently maintained by the project.
      2) Language selection in user prefs (to override browser defaults)
      3) Even better automatic language detection

David  31 Jan 2005
    - Changed the way the core client handles <delete_file_info> elements
        in scheduler RPC replies.
        Old: clear the FILE_INFO's sticky bit
        New: set a FILE_INFO::marked_for_delete flag.
            An unreferenced file will be deleted if this flag is set,
            regardless of whether the sticky flag is set.
            If the marked_for_delete flag is set,
            it won't be reported in scheduler RPCs,
            even if the report_on_rpc flag is set.
        This avoids situations where a server asks the client to delete a file,
        but later sends work to that file
        because it's reported in an RPC file list

    - Fixed trivial bug in scheduler which caused messages sent to clients
      < 4.62 to be interchanged with their priority.  So if the message was
      supposed to be 'No work available' with priority 'low', the actual
      message sent was 'low'.

    - Improvements to the file deletion mechanism.  Now try removing files if
      no work was sent to hosts, and available space<0 OR if available space>0
      but work was unfeasible because the disk bound requirements of the work
      exceeded the available space.
   -  Added a new config.xml boolean element called 'choose_download_url_by_timezone'
      This requires that projects provide a 2-column file in the project root named
      'download_servers'.  An example is:
           3600   http://einstein.aei.mpg.de
         -21600   http://einstein.phys.uwm.edu
      The first column is offset from UTC in seconds, and the second column is the URL
      of the download server.  When enabled, the scheduler will replace the download
      path for data and executables by a list of download URLs, ordered by proximity
      to the host's timezone.  The download path must start with the
      BOINC default download/ and the different download servers must have identical
      file paths under download/, in other words they must be mirrored.

      This prevents the work generation library from having to go back and
      continuously regenerate the md5 sums of your input data files.  Note
      that reading these from disk can be expensive if you have many such files
      that are large and that you re-use. See check-in notes from 30/31 Dec 2004

    - Scheduler: make things more uniform between locality
        and non-locality (work array) scheduling.
        Both cases use the following functions:
        1) call wu_is_feasible() to see if the host has enough
            disk, memory, and CPU speed to handle a result.
            (added this to locality scheduling)
        2) call add_result_to_reply() when you decide to send a result.
            This updates database and SCHED_REPLY.
    - If using locality scheduling, add_result_to_reply() doesn't
        decrement wreq.disk_available,
        since several results may involve the same file.
        BRUCE: we need to decrement disk_available in
        the locality scheduling code.
    - add disk space check to wu_is_feasible()
        (and removed it from scan_work_array())

    - The critically important "work_req_seconds" field of a scheduler request
        was not documented anywhere.
        The units of this request are "normalized CPU seconds":
        the request specifies the number of wall-clock seconds
        the work should take to finish using 1 CPU on the host,
        taking into account resource share, on_frac, and active_frac.
        - client side:
            document;
            take on_frac into account
        - server side:
            document;
            use wall-clock instead of cpu estimate for "seconds filled";
            take on_frac into account in wallclock estimate.
        TODO: it would be simpler if the request just specified a number of FLOPs .
             That way the server wouldn't have to
            know about on_frac, resource share etc.

    - Change the way user cross-project ID is maintained.
        OLD: when the client sends a scheduler RPC to project P,
            it sends the largest CPID among projects with same
            email hash as P.
            This is saved in P's database and sent in future RPC replies.
        Problem (pointed out by John McLeod):
            A user's CPID can change whenever he joins a new project.
            Statistics web sites don't have permanent IDs for a user.
        NEW: when the client sends a scheduler RPC to project P,
            it sends the CPID of the project for which user_create_time
            is least (i.e. the project with the oldest account).
            Project URL is used as a tie-breaker.

    - Fixed a bug where user_create_time wasn't being
        parsed correctly from server reply.

    -Unfortunately on some 32 bit systems there is a problem with wx-widgets
     configuring itself for largefile support.  On these systems largefile
     support breaks C++ compiles by defining away many of the C standard library
     routines that should reside in namespace std::.  In order to get around
     problem first we have to check the largefile support macros.  Later we will
     use the macro SAH_LARGEFILE_BREAKS_CXX to check for the breakage.  If
     if breakage is found LARGEFILE_BREAKS_CXX is defined in config.h.  This
     define is checked in std_fixes.h and the appropriate functions are defined
     in order to solve the problem. (These functions were already in place)
     Because these defines affect the behavior of standard library headers,
     std_fixes.h is being included from config.h
    -Added AM_CPPFLAGS, AM_CFLAGS, and AM_CXXFLAGS (for flags common to all
     compiles) so they will be defined in all Makefile.am files.
    -Put #ifdef _cplusplus around the C++ specific items in std_fixes.h so it
     may be included from C source files.

        Problem: the FCGI library inexplicably doesn't provide
        a version of fscanf().
        Some of Bruce's recent additions
        (timezone-dependent URL, MD5 caching) use fscanf().
        I commented them out with the _USING_FCGI_ symbol.
        This shouldn't affect anyone since E@h doesn't use FCGI.

    More sched locality and other scheduler changes.
    - Address David's comment of Feb 2.
        Now properly reduce the disk size resource requirements
        of a WU being sent if the file is already on the host,
        or already included in a previous WU being sent.
        DAVID: please check that reply_copy.wus.pop_back() is right.
    - For this, define a function host_has_file().
        This can also be used in the future for more intelligent
        file deletion schemes.
    - Make warnings to upgrade old clients have low priority until
        3 days before deadline.  Then high priority.
    - Fix sign error in messages sent to users about insufficient disk space.
    - Move extract_filename() from sched_locality.C to sched_util.C
    - Pretty up the ordered list of URLs printed for a given host.
    - I've even tested these changes before committing them!

      Added code to the scheduler so that it will dump core on SEGV.
      This is disabled by default.
      Having this is really useful if the scheduler is crashing
      some of the time.
      You can load the core dump file into a debugger to see where things are
      breaking.  To use this, edit sched/main.C by hand and set
      #define DUMP_CORE_ON_SEGV 1

    Fixes to get server components compiling under FCGI.
    - Added check for _USING_FCGI_ in std_fixes.h in order to prevent 
      redefinition of stdlib functions with LARGEFILE_BREAKS_CXX is defined.
    - Because FCGI doesn't have fscanf() and fgetc() that work on FCGI_FILE*, 
      the FILE pointers for these functions need to be wrapped in a call to 
      FCGI_ToFILE().  In the case where FCGI isn't being used we define
      FCGI_ToFILE(x) to (x).

    - Bug Fix: Inconsistant window state was causing the BOINC Manager to
        be blank on startup, basically either wxWidgets or Windows wasn't
        properly dealing with the Window state changes and the client
        would believe it was not being displayed when in fact it was on
        the screen.  When the window was hidden from view, it would
        skip updating any of the controls.

    - There was a problem using dynamic allocations (with new) in many of the
      graphics classes.  In many places the code was written assuming default 
      values of 0, especially for pointers and booleans.  While that's true 
      in the case of a static instance with the default constructors, it not
      generally true with dynamic allocation unless the default constructor 
      is replaced.  Therefore I've added constructors in the following 
      classes/structs:  MOVING_TEXT_PANEL, COLOR, PROGRESS, PROGRESS_2D,
      TEXTURE_DESC, REDUCED_ARRAY.  
    - This will be a problem is any are used from C code unless the 
      constructors declarations are enclosed in "#ifdef __cplusplus" blocks.
    - There was also a problem that showed up under Windows when dynamic 
      allocations were used.  app_graphics_resize() gets called before 
      app_graphics_init().  This usually results in a crash since classes
      haven't yet been constructed.  To work around this I've added a case
      for WM_CREATE in the WndProc() which calls app_graphics_init.  Under
      windows this will get passed before WM_SIZE does.

    - Sched locality change: if the host does not have enough memory to satisfy
      a work request, do not search for or send further work.  This is the same
      way that disk space limits are handled.  This is necessary since otherwise
      a host with small memory will endlessly trigger the WU generator, churning
      out infeasible WUs.
    - Added boolean arg to host_has_file() following David A's advice. This
      eliminates the 'expensive' copy of a large data structure. The bool arg
      makes host_has_file() skip the final WU in the vector in hunting for a file.
    - Better log message for setting coredump size.
I   - Added RCSID tag to sched_timezone.C

    - Allow remote application graphics via X11.  This involves:

    - Scheduler changes (global):
    - Ignore CPU limitations and resource share entirely, IF
      a host:
        (1) has no work for this project
        (2) has no results in this sched reply
      This ensures that any host that wants to do work will at least
      get *something*. It liberalizes slightly David A's approach
      from 14 Feb 2005. Eliminate use_time_stats from wreq structure.
    - Scheduler changes (locality scheduling only):
    - Improve return value info for some functions.
    - Modify send_old_work() to accept a t_min < t < t_max time range
    - New sched locality algorithm to send work to hosts with no files.
      Send oldest result in the time range A < t < B where
      B = locality_scheduling_timeout/2
      A = B - rand*locality_scheduling_timeout/2
      Here rand is a uniformly distributed random number in [0,1].
    - When an unsent result is older than locality_scheduling_timeout, no
      longer send it to the FIRST host that requests work.  Instead send
      it to the first host which has a connection speed > 100kb/s.
    - Fix file deletion.  Previously we were deleting files from hosts
      when they got no work for that file.  But this might have been
      because the work was infeasible (cpu time).  Now delete files
      from host ONLY if there is no work remaining for that file.

    - More sensible use of request_delay.  If a host contacts the
      scheduler, and fails to get work because there are N secs
      of pending work, then send a delay request of min(3600, N/5) secs.
      Otherwise the same host was coming back every hour, without being able
      to get additional work.
    - Implemented by adding a method set_delay() to
      SCHEDULER_REQUEST. This sets the delay to the maximum of the
      previous requested delay or the current requested delay. The
      delay is NEVER set longer than two days.

    - Added security checks to forum moderation features
    - Added project specific translation ability to the translator:
            To use this you simply add language files and tokens in the 
            project specific language directory:
            /html/languages/project_specific_translations/
            There's a dummy en.po file there to show how it is done.
            You use the tr(TOKEN)-function to get your token translated.
            It is possible to override the BOINC-provided translation by
            redefining the TOKEN in the project specific translation files.
    - Changed the translator to use the project default language as interface
      instead of having to explicitly write everything in a seperate file.
      Therefore you do no longer  have to add tokens to the 
      language_interface-file.

    Fixed a bug in locality scheduling.  When old work was being sent,
    the daily_result_quota constraint was not being enforced.
    Normally this constraint is enforced in the work_needed()
    function.  However note that the critical send_work() function
    NEVER checks work_needed() [DAVID, perhaps it should?] before
    calling send_work_locality() or scan_work_array().  Then, when
    send_work_locality() was called, it would in turn call
    send_old_work() immediately, WITHOUT checking to see if
    work_needed() was TRUE.  This allowed the daily_result_quota
    constraint to be broken.

    Possible fixes included:
      test work_needed() before calling send_old_work()
      test work_needed() WITHIN send_old_work()
      test work_needed() within possibly_send_result()
      test work_needed() within wu_is_infeasible()

    Conclusion: work is ONLY sent by the function
    possibly_send_result() which is called in two places in
    sched_locality.C: once in send_results_for_file() and once in
    send_old_work().  The first of these DOES check the value of
    work_needed().  The second does NOT.  So I added a check of
    work_needed() within send_old_work().  A also added
    added another check of work_needed() at the top of
    send_results_for_file() BEFORE any DB access is done.  It might be
    better to put this test of work_needed() lower down (within
    possibly_send_result()) or higher up (where send_old_work())
    is called.  I am not sure. David, I'd appreciate your advice.

    - Bug fixes to scheduler code
    - For locality scheduler, if anonymous platform lacks app,
        don't do deterministic search for work!
    - For locality scheduler, remove 'unsent' constraint from initial query
        so that existing index in result table can be used to perform
        a more efficient search.
    - Send multi-message replies to core clients > 4.19
    - Change 'no work available' message to 'no work sent'
        since this is often due to constraints at the client end,
        NOT lack of work at project end.

        so that "bad hosts" (those that always return either errors or nothing)
        are eventually cut back to 1 result per day.

        Added "max_results_day" field to host table.
        Initialized to config.daily_result_quota.
        When host returns an error result, or a result times out,
        decrement max_results_day (but not below 1).
        When the host return a success result,
        double max_results_day (but not above config.daily_result_quota)

        Idea is from Bruce Allen

    If you attached to a project and give a URL like "a.b.c//",
    two bad things happen:
    1) canonicalize_master_url() strips off everything before the //,
        leaving an empty URL
    2) it will write an account file account_.xml
        and make an entry in the client state file
    3) next time the core client starts up, it errors out
        trying to create the project directory.
    Fixes:
    - canonicalize_master_url(): check before "://", not "//"
    - is_account_file(): tighten up.
        Old: anything starting with account_ is considered an account file.
        New: must match account_A.B.xml where A and B are nonempty
    - invalid_url():
        Old: must match http://X, X nonempty
        New: must match http://X.Y/, X and Y nonempty
        rename to valid_master_url() and invert sense

    - user web: got rid of the "project_callbacks.inc" file.
        "project.inc" is already being used for this purposes.
        The project-specific functions must be defined there,
        perhaps empty.
        Also removed _callback from function names - they're
        not callbacks in the conventional sense.
        Also, these functions are expected to print, not return a string
        (so they can call row2() and stuff like that)
    - if a WU is pending validation, show that
    - change CHARSET of english translation to UTF-8

    - Bug Fix: Instead of relying on the wxWidget framework for UI
        updates for various menu items, move the update code to the
        OnFrameRender function so we don't eat CPU in what seems
        to be a busy loop.  It seems for platforms other than Windows
        the Idle event is fired for each iteration of a message pump
        check where no other events were processed.  On Windows their
        is an actual message sent by the OS called WM_IDLE which is
        used by wxWidgets.

    Removed Eric Heien's old boinc.pbroj which is confusing 
    on CVS because it is a bundle, which looks like a directory

    - Changes for Mac GUI BOINC manager and core client.
    Major rework of XCode project file.
    BOINC Manager has standard Mac application bundle with icon.
    Client doesn't ask for User ID or Project URL on command line.
    Added code for Mac to determine idle time (user inactivity).
    Core Client is embedded in BOINC Manager application bundle.
    BOINC Manager sets working directory to 
        ~/Application Support/Boinc_Data/

        something is up is by looking into the messages tab, but

      E@H specific is now included (but protected by
      #ifdef EINSTEIN_AT_HOME
      to make it simpler for me to maintain consistency with BOINC cvs.
    - Added project-specific unacceptable_os() function for rejecting hosts.
    - Transitioner and scheduler now initalize host.max_results_day correctly
      in database under all circumstances.
    - Browser requests are now correctly identifed (REQUEST_METHO=="GET") and
      properly redirected.  This was broken. David, please see comment near
      one of the probable_user_browser=true in handle_request.C.  I think
      something is wrong here (or I am missing the point!).
    - More info about requests is logged
    - If the scheduler hangs (incoming request incomplete) it will normally be
      killed by Apache after a timeout.  But this happens silently.  So I now
      install a signal handler and catch this SIGTERM.  In this case an
      error message is logged and all open files are flushed before exit(1)ing.
    - If IO is passed through files, check that request length and content length
      agree and log a message if they do NOT.
    - active_frac not correctly reported by 4.19 and earlier core clients.
      Adjust for this in estimating wallclock execution times.

    - Well now that I've fully tested and deployed BOINC via Active Directory,
        I found something wrong.  When deploying BOINC to the computer via
        Active Directory the installation runs as the computer account when
        copying files so files can be read off a network share, but when we get
        to the CopyAccountFiles custom action setup would fail since LOCALSYSTEM
        only has access to the local machine.

      The solution is to include the account files and any other configuration
        file as part of the BOINC MSI transform which needs to be created in
        order to populate the global properties for deployment.  The setup
        documentation will be updated to reflect this change.

    - Bug Fix: Attempting to install BOINC in a managed environment would fail
        since ALLUSERS is automatically set to 1 for any installation type.  So
        if we detect that we are being installed in a managed environment
        ignore the ALLUSERS value.

      Menu items are still installed for all users though, that'll be fixed
        a little later.

        (DB_TRANSITIONER_ITEM_SET::update_workunit()),
        only update those fields that have changed since we read it.
        This is an attempt to deal with the following scenario:

        1) validator finds canonical result, triggers assimilation,
            sets assimilate_state = READY
        2) transitioner reads WU
        3) assimilator reads WU and updates assimilate_state = DONE
        4) transitioner writes WU (with assimilate_state still READY)
        5) assimilator processes WU again (ERROR)

    BOINC Manager: Work around apparent bug in Mac version of WxWidgets 
    which prevented the main window's size and position from being 
    restored on application launch.
    Main widow close box doesn't quit application. 
    Postponed implementing the umask change due to security concerns:  
    removed umask(0) from Core Client & BOINC Manager; changed BOINC 
    Data directory back to user's "~/Library/Application Support/"
    Automate generating Mac version numbers from version.h file. (Added 
    shell script build phase and tiny SetVersion shell application to 
    XCode project to create / update InfoPlist.strings file.)
    CViewProjects::OnTaskLinkClicked(): added casts to change compiler 
    errors to compiler warnings; this allows it to compile.

    - Fixed bug where clients report a result CPU time as zero,
        even though the result used a lot of CPU.
        The basic problem was in the API: the final call to
        update_app_progress() (from boinc_finish())
        was trying to send a status message.
        But some fraction of the time the message slot was full
        (core client hadn't read previous message)
        so this message wouldn't get delivered.
        Core client was using checkpoint_cpu_time as final CPU,
        so (for applications that never checkpoint)
        the core client would never get a nonzero checkpoint_cpu_time.

        I fixed this at both ends, i.e. if you either use a new core client
        with old apps, or use new apps with existing core clients,
        the problem will go away.
        Fixes:

        1) API: retry sending final status message a few times w/ sleep
        2) core client: use current_cpu_time rather than checkpoint_cpu_time
            as the result's final_cpu_time.
    - core client: show current directory on startup

    - Apparently, even though the port number 1043 is assigned to BOINC
        (see http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers)
        Microsoft IIS binds to it on some systems.
        So...
        core client: if can't bind to 1043, bind to 31416
        BOINC mgr: if can't connect to 31416, connect to 1043

        If something is bound to 31416 we're screwed.

    - Lots of updates for the website translation system:
      -    Now creates missing dirs when first installed
      -    Supports "dual ID" language files (ie those files that have
           names like xx_YY (for instance zh_TW for the Chinese)
           Please note the use of lower- and uppercase letters.
      -    You can now override the automatic selection by the use of
           a cookie named "lang". A page for setting this cookie has also
           been made (language_select.php).
      -    The automatic selection now searches for all the languages that
           the user's browser specifies before using the project default
           (ie. it no longer uses only the first language that the browser
           gives it in the string).
      -    Made some small additions to en.po so that the language select page
           can display the correct names of the languages instead of their
           ISO names: "Danish (Dansk)" instead of "da".
      -    Added some more logging so that missing tokens will be printed to
           the logfile as well as on screen.
    - Added the title on the sample forum index page to en.po

    - Maintain the "main host venue" in a more robust way.
        (Reminder: the "main host venue" is the host venue of the
        project that supplied the most recent global prefs.
        Host venues for each project are stored in account files.
        The global prefs file identifies the source project.)

        Old: main host venue is stored in the client state file,
            and updated only when a scheduler RPC returns
            global prefs with a new host venue.
        Problem: if it's missing from the client state file
        it may never get set to the correct value.

        New: on startup, the global prefs file is parsed once
        to obtain the source project.
        Then main host venue is computed, based on the source
        project and the host venue specified in its account file.
        Then the global prefs file is parsed again, using this venue.
    - user web: add option for columnar prefs display.
        Append "&cols=1" to prefs.php URL
    - boinc_cmd (command-line tool): fix bugs and improve argument checking.

    - BOINC manager: new "statistics" tab (from Jens Breitbart)
        Here's Jens' summary of changes:
        - Client
          * Statistics are stored on a daily basis
            ~ Statistics := {User & host total credit, user & host avg. credit}
            ~ max. 30 days are stored
          * Statistics are gathered after the client has contacted the scheduler
            ~ No extra call to the scheduler is made, just information already
              provided are stored
          * Added support for the RPC call "<get_statistics/>"
            ~ Answer include all saved statistics from all projects
            ~ Syntax of the answer:
              <statistics>
                  <project_statistics>
                     <master_url>%s</master_url>
                     <daily_statistics>
                        <day>%f</day>
                        <user_total_credit>%f</user_total_credit>
                        <user_expavg_credit>%f</user_expavg_credit>
                        <host_total_credit>%f</host_total_credit>
                        <host_expavg_credit>%f</host_expavg_credit>
                     </daily_statistics> <- repeated for each day
                  </project_statistics> <- repeated for each project
              </statistics>
          * Statistics are saved in files called "statistics_master_url.xml"
            ~ Syntax is similar to the one shown above except every project is
              saved in its own file
            ~ Files are saved after every scheduler reply
            ~ Files are read at client start
            ~ Files are deleted on project detach
        - Manager
          * Added a statistic tab
            ~ Drawing the graph on a wxPanel using the paint event.
            ~ wxPlottWindow not working very reliable...
            ~ Design is looking quite simple
          * Using the RPC "<get_statistics/>" to get the Information from the client

        which as far as I can tell involved the core client asking
        the screensaver to ask it to do graphics again.
        Instead, the core client just tells another app to start doing SSG.
        It hangs on to the last GRAPHICS_MSG

    - Added the connecting state to the status bar since the UI was displaying

    - Bug Fix: Explicitly declare the network connection thread as a joinable
        thread, by default wxWidgets defines the default behavior as detached 
        which handles its own destruction.

      NOTE: The documentation also states that on Windows all threads are 
        joinable, so in the end, the crashes were related to me attempting to
        cleanup the thread when it had already deleted itself, which caused a 
        double free situation.

    - Attempt to fix the situation where:
        1) user merges hosts; hosts with lower IDs are folded
            into host with maximal ID, then deleted
        2) If host's client_state.xml file still has one of the
            lower IDs, then the next time it contacts the scheduler,
            the host lookup fails and a new host record is created,
            which defeats the purpose of the merge.

        Solution:
            - When merge hosts, don't delete lower-ID records.
                Instead, change them to "zombie" state, in which:
                - userid is zero
                - rpc_seqno is ID of new host record
            - scheduler: if host is zombie, follow link to new host,
                send back its ID to client

            which wasn't present here ("localhost")
        2) the Python code for signing executables needed to look

            Also move file size checking logic here.
        PERS_FILE_XFER::start_xfer(): use FILE_INFO::verify_downloaded_file()

            rather than doing a bunch of checks manually
        PERS_FILE_XFER::poll(): don't check size on completion of xfer.
            Leave it to verify_downloaded_file().

    - file_upload_handler: when responding to a request for the
      file length, check first that the file is not already
      in open (locked) by another file_upload_handler.  If the
      file IS open (locked), then do NOT hand back the file length.
      Instead return a transient error. This will prevent
      transmission of upload data starting at the wrong offset.
    - file_upload_handler: ignore <data_server_request>tag
    - To help understand when/why multiple file_upload_handlers
      are trying to write to the same file, set default log level
      to DEBUG.  Also log messages at level CRITICAL if there is
      an attempt to write to a locked file. We may want to change
      this level to DEBUG in the future, if this turns out to be
      'normal' TCP buffering of data between host and server.

      fseek.  We now check that the file size corresponds exactly to the
      claimed offset of the data.  If they do not agree then return a
      transient error to force the host to ask again for the file length
      and re-transmit data.

    - rework of file_upload_handler.  I learned that is it not
      reliable to use flock/lockf/fnctl file locking with buffered
      IO.  This is because the stream libraries might unexpectedly
      open/close/dup file descriptors on you.  So I have modified
      the file write/append functions to use raw IO rather than
      buffered IO.  In doing this I also found and fixed some small
      bugs. There is no guarantee that one can mix flock/lockf/fnctl
      file locking so I have settled on fnctl since it is POSIX and
      gives the most control.

      So to the lowest order in diff:
      weight = 1 - diff ln(2) / half_life

      avg += (1-weight)*(work/diff_days)
      avg += [diff*ln(2)/half_life] * (work*SECONDS_PER_DAY/diff)

    - bug fix so that Unix hosts report their timezones correctly
      taking into account the effect of DST on their localtime.

      NOTE: hosts that lacked a gmt offset in the tm structure (System V
      with no BSD extensions) had the WRONG SIGN for the timezone.
      This is now fixed. These host types (AIX, Cygwin?) will now have a
      change in sign in their timezone, making it consistent with other
      Unix hosts and with Win32 hosts.

    - Note that with these changes we adopt the convention that the database
      timezone value is the (Local Standard Time) - (UTC time).  This
      quantity only depends upon spatial location on the earth's surface and
      is NOT a function of time.

Rebuild WxMac-2.6.0 library with OS 10.3.0 compatibility SDK.
Update build instructions.  Update version number in various 
*info.plist files.  Update ReadMe file.  Better logic for avoiding 
annoying flashes in screensaver.  Avoid screensaver hang if graphics 
application is non-responsive.  Installer: don't require reboot; 
launch BOINC at end of install; refuse to install if OS < 10.3; 
set up BOINC Data directory properly if installed by non-admin user.

    - When running benchmarks, close down and remove science applications
        from memory.  If a science application isn't listening to the quit request
        it may not be responding to suspend/resume either which would cause problems
        during the benchmark process.
    - If a science application doesn't shutdown within 10 seconds, kill it.
    - Fix the bug I introduced last night with the view statistics tab.
    - Make suspend_all call atp->preempt() instead of doing the same thing itself.
    - Move the starting benchmark message to a place right before the benchmarks
        start.  We were receiving a few process control messages and people might
        interpret that to mean other stuff was going on during the benchmarks.

Eric    05/05/05  Woo Hoo!
    - Modified the BOINC_GETSOCKOPT_TYPE macro so it determines the proper type
        of parameter 5 to getsockopt() by using the compiler.
        The macro was in danger of becoming an ever expanding list of
        case statements, since some platforms 
      use socklen_t, others use size_t, and still others use int.  Some aren't 
      even consistent from OS rev to OS rev.
    - A macro BOINC_SOCKLEN_T is set in config.h to indicate the proper type.  
      This is typedef to be boinc_socklen_t in lib/network.h.  The special cases 
      for __APPLE__ and WIN32 can probably be removed at a later time.  Places 
      where socklen_t was used have been changed to boinc_socklen_t.
    - Added double inclusion protection to network.h
    - Added libtool.m4 so porters don't need to install libtool.

    - Really make optional fields (postal code and url) optional
         For those who rewrite stuff to using get_str etc please remember to
         consider if the variable is optional (add true to get_str) or not.
    - Added support for css class names in start_forum_table:
         Use array(array("Header 1", "style_name_1"), "Header 2", array("Header 3", "style_name_2"))
         It defaults to the old "heading" style.
    - Checking in patch from Rob Oglivie:
         - Figured out how to simply merge two objects together in
           db_forum.inc's forum preferences function
         - Moved forum-related text transforming functions in to
           text_transform.inc - these can certainly be used elsewhere
         - Defined a text transforming options class where default options 
           are set
         - Created a new output_transform() function that takes text and options
           and outputs text transformed as such.
         - Implemented said function in show_post and show_post2, as well as in
           the signature preview on edit_forum_preferences_form.php
         - Various wrappers and modifiers to clean up forum-related table
           display when people use long nonbreaking words for thread subjects or
           their usernames.  These fixes all work in Firefox.  IE, Opera, and KTHML
           users will get most of the benefits, but not all of them.
         - Wrote a page explaining how to use bbcode tags and linked to it
           instead of the allowed HTML tags section
         - After editing forum preferences, people are now taken back to the
           forum preferences page again - so they can see how it looks
         - Quoting text on the forums now uses bbcode instead of HTML
         - Added a signature delimiter
    - Renamed get_settings_from_user to get_transform_settings_from_user

      *some* invocations of this.  David, I'll send details to the dev mailing
      list or talk with you about it later this week.  Note: this code probably

    - (from Bruce Allen) fix bug in scheduler in case where
        host has been merged,
        and results are reported with old (zombie) host ID.
        Results in the DB have already been updated to new hostid;
        compare with that ID, not old ID

    - Bug Fix: The Mac screensaver sends us a MODE_HIDE_GRAPHICS even before
        it acknowledges the MODE_FULLSCREEN change which in turn tells the CC
        to shutdown the screensaver.  So lets improve the robustness of the
        shutdown logic to only shutdown the screensaver if the CC has received
        an ack for the MODE_FULLSCREEN message.

    - Bug Fix: After starting the CC wait for 5 seconds to give the CC time
        to establish the listening socket for the next rpc request.
    - Convert the remaining #ifdef'ed debug messages into scoped messages
        so they can be tracked in debug/release builds on all platforms.
    - We store most if not all time values internally as doubles, so make
        the calls to time(0) to dtime() to see if that fixes a deadline
        problem on the mac with the screensaver.

        request.
    - Fix what appears to be a long standing bug in the Windows screensaver
        where after the first execution of the screensaver the core client
        continues to report the screensaver mode as SS_STATUS_QUIT even when
        the screensaver is starting up for the second time which causes the

    - API: there seem to be problems with the user of timer signals
        in the BOINC API (Unix version).
        On some platforms the signals are delivered to both
        the worker and graphics thread,
        and they can deadlock on something down in _vprintf().

        Rather than try to sort this out,
        we'll switch to using a separate thread instead of signals.

    - Bug Fix: The ATI graphics drivers do not like to be told to switch
        to the original desktop and window station that the application started
        with.  So now the application will detect which window station and
        desktop it is currently running under and only switch if it is different
        from the desired desktop and window station.  There was no API
        failure codes to look for, the application believed everything was
        running like it was supposed to be.

        instead of BOINC.pmproj with PackageMaker 2.0 (XCode 2.0 / Tiger)

David  22 May 2005
    - debugged yesterday's API change on Linux.
        It worked OK except CPU time wasn't getting reported.
        It turns out that getrusage(), on Linux at least,
        returns CPU time only for the calling thread
        (in this case the timer thread,
        whereas we wanted the worker thread).

        So: put back a timer signal, but use it ONLY to get worker CPU time,
        and only do that if the worker thread is the one handling the signal.
        Store the worker CPU time in a variable (worker_thread_cpu_time)
        which is read by the timer thread.

        Aargh!!

        Still need to make sure this works on Mac OS X, Solaris etc.

    - Changed the interface for creating a GUI RPC connection.
        RPC_CLIENT::init() synchronous
        RPC_CLIENT::init_asynch(double timeout, bool retry)
            If retry is true, keep trying (alternating between
            alternate and main ports) until succeed or time out.
            This is used by the BOINC manager when it starts up
            the core client, since it may take many seconds before
            the core client runs and creates the listening socket.
    NOTE: the BOINC Manager sees if the core client is running by
        connecting to it.  It then closes this connection and connects again.
        Would be better to connect just once.

    - Add 2 new items to scheduler RPC request:
        - <other_results>
            List of other results for this project
            (besides those being reported, if any)
            This can be used by the scheduler to resend
            previously sent results that were lost somehow.
            Includes only the name of the result.
        - <in_progress_results>
            List of all results for which computation is not done.
            Includes estimated remaining CPU time, report deadline.
            This can be used by the scheduler to decide whether
            to send short-deadline results.

        Note 1: the scheduler doesn't use the above info yet.
            Need to get this code into clients first.

        Note 2: I used tag names <other_result> and <ip_result>
            for the results within each element.
            This will prevent the current scheduler from
            mistaking them for elements being reported.
            This is a kludge, but is fixed in new scheduler code
            (see next item)

    - add skip_unrecognized() function to lib/parse.C
        Call this when get an unrecognized line.
        If it's a single tag "<foo>",
        this will skip all lines up to and including "</foo>"

    - Restrict the account management mechanism to reduce its security risk.
        1) am_create.php now returns an error if an account
            (validated or not) exists with the given email address.
        2) The account-confirmation email cautions the recipient
            to ignore it if they didn't make the request
        2) am_query.php returns an error if an account with same email exists.
    - Add an "acct_mgr_name" argument to am_create.php so we can
        tell the user where the request came from

    The reason for this change is as follows.
    Suppose a hacker X knows or guesses the email address of a user Y.
    X sends an am_create RPC to the project.
    Y receives an email and, without thinking, clicks on the URL.
    X then does an am_query RPC and gets Y's authenticator.
    These changes prevent this attack.

    There's still a small security risk.
    A hacker could spam a project with am_create RPCs
    with various known email addresses.
    A small fraction of recipients might click on validate link,
    which would create accounts with authenticators known to the hacker.
    However I don't see this as a significant problem.

    - Reorganization of schedule RPC and master file fetch code
        trying to get rid of bug where once project's scheduler URLS
        end up in another project.

        The following conditions are either all true or all false:
            1) SCHEDULER_OP::project is nonzero
            2) SCHEDULER_OP::state is not IDLE
            3) SCHEDULER_OP::http_op is in HTTP_OP_SET.

        These become true in:
            SCHEDULER_OP::start_rpc()
            SCHEDULER_OP::init_master_fetch()

        These become false in:
            SCHEDULER_OP::poll() (when an operation finishes)
            SCHEDULER_OP::abort() (called when reset or abort project)

    - Changed SCHEDULER_OP from struct to class and hid some of its data

    - Scheduler: when send the client a delay request because
        it's contacted us before min_sendwork_interval,
        add an additional 1% to the delay request.
        This handles the case where the client's clock is

    code cleanup in CPU sched/work fetch area:
    - introduced concepts of
        "runnable result"
        "runnable project"
        "potentially runnable project"
        These encapsulate a lot of the checks
        (suspended via gui, blah blah) that we do everywhere.
        For each of these, added a bool function.
    - rename things in terms of these concepts, e.g.
        local_total_resource_share -> runnable_resource_share
            (i.e. sum of resource shares of runnable projects)
        local_total_lt_available_resource_share
            -> potentially_runnable_source_share
    - eliminate the use of PROJECT::next_runnable_result
        as an indicator of whether a project has a runnable result.
        Just call PROJECT::runnable().
        Eliminate the use of assign_results_to_project()
        to see if projects have a runnable result.
    - rename "debt" to "short_term_debt", including in client_state.xml

    - FILE_INFO::verify_file(): if a file fails verification,
        set its "status" field to the appropriate error code.
        This wasn't being done, so in most cases the
        core client would verify the file over and over.

        This was exacerbated by a bug I introduced 7 months and 3 weeks ago
        (and fixed earlier today).
        In CLIENT_STATE::update_result() I had

        if (now - last_time < 1.0) return false;
        last_time = 0;

        It should be "now", not zero.  This caused pending input files to
        get checked 10 times a second, rather than once.

        and getrusage() return CPU time for the entire process,

    - BOINC Manager: change things so that if user tries to
        attach to a project and it fails,
        an alert dialog shows up within a few seconds,
        saying what went wrong and what to do about it.

    This involves several pieces:

    - add a new core client message priority: MSG_ALERT.
        The accompanying message should be shown in an alert dialog.
    - CLIENT_STATE::add_project: show alert msg if URL or key is bad
    - project_add_failed(): add a "reason" argument,
        and show alert messages accordingly
    - change SCHEDULER_OP::check_master_fetch_start(), SCHEDULER_OP::poll()
        to call project_add_failed() with appropriate reason
    - CMainDocument::CachedMessageUpdate():
        scan new messages; if any are MSG_ALERT priority, show alert.
        Else append to main message vector.
    - CMainFrame::OnListPanelRender(): call pDoc->CachedMessageUpdate().
        This is the easiest way I could find of checking new messages
        every 5 seconds, even when not in the Messages tab.

    NOTE: there's one piece I didn't do.
    When the Manager connects to a core client with some ALERT messages
    already in its message log, it probably shouldn't show alerts for them.
    Rom, please figure out how to do this.

        This is the ratio between CPU time accumulated by BOINC apps

        It may be less than one if
        1) apps page or do I/O
        2) other CPU-intensive apps run

        This is computed with a 1-day exponential smoothing.

        For now, we're just computing this.
        At some point we'll use it to estimate how long will take.

    - core client: estimate CPU time to completion of an active result
        as a weighted average of estimates based on
        1) the workunit's flops count
        2) the current reported CPU time and fraction done,
        weighted by the fraction done.
        This gives better estimates for apps that don't
        estimate their fraction done well (e.g. SETI@home).
        It should eliminate a behavior where the client gets 1 result,
        starts running it, and immediately requests more work.
    - core client: fix bug where we'd to a master file fetch
        after every scheduler RPC
    - core client: show messages when downloading master page,
        and when it succeeds or fails

    NOTE: I was seeing a bug where each file transfer would fail
    immediately with a CONN_REFUSED error (10061 on Win),
    but would succeed on retry.
    This went away when I changed the settings on my
    Symantec Personal Firewall to not check outgoing connections.
    Seems like a bug in Symantec to me.

    - core client: don't reset projects on major version change

    client/
        client_state.C

David  14 June 2005
    - core client: use "potentially runnable resource share"
        instead of "total resource share" in several places:
        - estimating how long a project's work will take
        - how many CPUs a project should occupy
        - the "resource share fraction" reported to schedulers

        The idea: if a process is not potentially runnable
        (e.g. because it's suspended by user)
        it's not going to get CPU time,
        so it shouldn't be included in resource share calculations.
        (suggested by Jim Harris)
    - rename CLIENT_STATE::ettprc() to time_until_work_done();
        add a "subset resource share" parameter
    - get rid of the global variable "trs" (total resource share)
    - make proj_min_results() a member of CLIENT_STATE,
        remove the "ncpus" param, and add a "subset resource share" param
    - CLIENT_STATE::avg_proc_rate() now computes processing rate
        across all projects
    - Multiply by TIME_STATS::cpu_efficiency in avg_proc_rate()
    - add functions runnable_resource_share() and
        potentially_runnable_resource_share() to CLIENT_STATE
    - set_cpu_scheduler_modes(): remove "* ncpus" from
         if (frac_booked > MAX_CPU_LOAD_FACTOR * up_frac * ncpus)
         (John: is this right?)

    Note: in some cases (e.g. if the work-fetch policy has
    decided to get work only for 1 or 2 project),
    the set of projects used in resource share calculations
    should be smaller than the potentially runnable ones.
    It's not clear how to do this.

    - in set_scheduler_modes(), moved result checks that
        don't involve EDF simulation out of the loop that does EDF simulation.
    - in set_scheduler_modes(), change logic so that booked_to
        is in units of wall time, not CPU time.
        Makes things clearer.
    - removed the frac_booked logic from set_scheduler_modes().
        I don't think this is correct.
        e.g. result A has deadline 1, CPU 1; result B has deadline 2, CPU 1.
        Then frac_booked would be 1.5, but we can meet both deadlines
    - renamed MAX_CPU_LOAD_FACTOR to CPU_PESSIMISM_FACTOR

        It's fatally flawed because it assumes all results
        from a project are the same #FLOPs.

        This version (CLIENT_STATE::rr_misses_deadline())
        models the fact that when all the work for a project is finished,
        the fractional resource share of other runnable projects increases.
        So, e.g., a few short results and one long one,
        which almost saturates the CPU, is feasible.

    - Account management: move responsibility for the

        from the manager to the core client.
        Do this because only the core client knows when an

        unless this happens, these files should not be changed.

        Add new type ACCT_MGR_INFO to core client

    - GUI principle for manager:
        For any user action that can potentially fail
        (project attach, acct mgr update)
        ALWAYS show an alert when the action is finished.
        E.g. show "Attach succeeded" if an attach succeeds.
        Don't require users to look in Messages for outcome.
    - Add a "show_alerts" argument to add_project().
        Says whether to show alert when attach succeeds or fails.
        True for attaches via GUI,
        false for others (e.g. account manager attaches)
    - SCHEDULER_OP::backoff(): if account is tentative,
        call attach_failed().

    - Add two new GUI RPCs that let the Manager be in charge of
        opening and closing modem connections.

        network_query() returns true if the CC wants a network connection,
            or is currently using one.
            NOTE: wait to get false twice (with a few seconds delay)
            before closing a connection

        network_available() tells the CC that a connection is available,
            and that it should do all the network activity it can.

        These are relevant only on Windows.

        Implementation:
        - CLIENT_STATE has a new member, bool want_network_flag.
            If the CC tries to create a network connection and
            there's no physical connection, it sets this.
        - network_query() return true is want_network_flag is set
            or there an HTTP_OP.
        - network_available() resets all backoff timers
            (of PERS_FILE_XFERs and PROJECTs) to zero,
            so everything will be retried immediately.

    - Initial checkin of Dial-up connection support for service and shared
        install states.  Prompting for connect/disconnect requests is now
        handled in the manager instead of the CC so the CC won't lock up
        when configured to confirm before connect.

        When multiple ISP's are detected but none are defined as the default
        another dialog will appear giving you a choice as to which ISP to
        use.

        If the manager is hidden then the taskbar will display a balloon
        stating that BOINC needs to connect and by opening the BOINC
        manager you'll be able to connect up and update all projects.
    - Added an 'Update All' button to the projects tab.
    - More manager code clean-up
    - Make alerts show up as a balloon if the manager is hidden.  Model
        dialogs can be annoying when your typing an email or document and
        it pops up right in front of the document.  What is even worse is
        if you are typing and dismiss the dialog before you have even had a
        chance to look at it.  The balloons show up in the lower right hand
        corner and automatically go away after 5 seconds or so.
    - If alerts already exist in the message queue when you connect up
        to a remote computer, ignore them.

David  24 June 2005
    - API library: potential bug:
        if the core client sends a "quit" message that is handled
        (by the timer handler) while the worker thread is
        in the middle of checkpointing,
        the result could be an incomplete checkpoint,
        which in general screws up the result.
        Same problem exists if the app exits due to no CC heartbeat
        while a checkpoint is in progress.

        Solution: if boinc_time_to_checkpoint() returns true,
        it sets a flag (checkpointing) that suppresses
        the handling of process control messages
        and the checking of heartbeat timeout.
        boinc_checkpoint_completed() clears the flag.

        One consequence of this design:
        if boinc_time_to_checkpoint() returns true,
        you HAVE to checkpoint immediately.
        So don't call boinc_time_to_checkpoint() unless
        you're prepared to checkpoint.

    - Always show the reason for a scheduler RPC: either
        - requested by user
        - results due for reporting
        - fetching work

        Implementation: add "reason" argument to init_op_project().
        Store in SCHEDULER_OP.
        This eliminates the need for must_get_work.
        Remove init_return_results().
    - handle RPC init errors (by backing off) in init_op_project(),
        NOT in the functions that call it (e.g. init_get_work()).
        We were backing off twice for the same error.
    - network_query GUI RPC: return false if network suspended by user
    - Manager: remove wxASSERT(fBuffer)
        from CViewReousrces::FormatDiskSpace().

    Mac: Integrated Hide of BOINCManager with close of main Manager window.  
    Closing window hides Manager application, opening window (from menubar 
    icon menu or from Dock menu) Shows application.  Hiding or showing 
    application closes or opens window.  This eliminates having just the 
    manager's menu bar pop up when a foreground application quits.
    Disable all application-specific menu items in Dock menu and menubar 
    icon menu when a modal dialog is active.  This matches the disabling 
    of items in the Manager's regular menus.
    Fixed bug where all items in menubar icon menu were disabled, which 
    required clicking on the icon repeatedly.

      issued a hours 17 and 18, and both timed out (no reply). At
      time 17+deadline the first would time out and a new result
      would be issued.  But then instead of setting the transition
      time to 18+deadline it would be set to 18+deadline+1 day.

      To prevent thrashing I have fixed this so that if a transition
      time is in the past, I advance it by TWICE the amount it is late,
      but never less than 1 minute or more than 1 day.

      unsent results show create time rather than deadline.

          send_work(), which was too late for the resend_lost_work() part
          of the code.  You might want to move all the initialization of reply.wreq
          out of send_work().   The core client version is needed to see if the
          app is compatible with it when calling get_app_version().
      (2) In retransmitting lost work, do NOT set the deadline to new
          values.  Else the result will never time out!  But DO reset
          the sent_time, to indicate that result was resent.
    - transitioner:
          In the transitioner, make the next WU transition time be the min
          of deadlines of the in progress results, NOT the min of the
          sent_time+delay bound.  Unless a project wants to do dynamic
          adjustment of delay bounds for in progress results this should be OK.

    - file_deleter: added a new argument -delete_antiques.
      If this switch is enabled on the command line, then
      periodically (once per hour) removes any files in the
      upload/ directory that are older than the oldest WU in the
      database.  These files are created when BOINC clients
      return work really late after the deadline -- so late that
      the corresponding WU has been deleted from the database.
      About half the results in the E@H upload/ directory were
      of this form.  The 'find' command is used to locate such
      files.  This is potentially a dangerous operation since
      if we find then delete the wrong file(s) all hell could
      break lose on the server.  So a lot of 'paranoia and
      sanity checking' is done before unlink(path) is called,
      and we bail out at the first sign of something odd.

    - Initial checkin for Curl-based core client.
        This will allow the client to use HTTPS for any purpose
        (main page, scheduler URL, file upload/download),
        and it will eventually eliminate the funky/complex
        HTTP and proxy code in the core client.

        For now, this should have no effect on standard compiles;
        everything is #ifdef'd to use the old HTTP code.

    - The (hopefully) last chapter in the saga of the Unix BOINC API.
        We had previously waffled between using a signal handler
        and using a timer thread.
        Each has a fatal flaw: you can't do sprintf() (or pretty
        much anything else) from an asynch signal handler,
        and suspend and CPU time reporting don't work if you use a thread.

        The new design uses both a signal handler and a thread!
        The signal handler does the bare minimum -
        calling getrusage() and sleep() -
        and the timer thread does the message sending and receiving
        (using sprintf() etc.)

    - Change the way bools are parsed in log_flags.xml

        To turn a flag off:
            <foobar>0</foobar>

        This lets you override the defaults
        (where task, file_xfer and sched_ops are true)

        Note: this is already the way things work in sched_config.xml.
        I moved the relevant function (parse_bool()) into parse.C,

      apple-powerpc-darwin7.9.  Without this the core client
      reports back a platform version that the server does not

    - Happily, I found a more elegant solution than renaming functions & variables
    from boinc_zip to zlib.
    The InfoZip has a define "USE_ZLIB" which will take into account
    that you have zlib available.
    Since that is the de-facto boinc
    (i.e. we're all using zlib now)
    then boinc_zip can reflect this;
    and I have updated the necessary files.

      And it didnt work right with the caching mechanism because they may 
      become inactive while still being in the cache.

    - core client: use of libcurl is now default on Unix
        NOTE: curl version 7.14.0 or higher is recommended.
        7.10 does not work.
        Install it in /usr, not /usr/local
    - core client: change the polling structure for
        lower latency for GUI RPCs and higher throughput for file xfers.
        Polling for non-time-critical changes is done in
        CLIENT_STATE::poll_slow_events(),
        which is called once per second
        (and repeatedly, if anything changes).
        All I/O activites are done in CLIENT_STATE::do_io_or_sleep(x),
        which returns after about x seconds,
        doing as much I/O as it can in the process.
        It does a select() across all descriptors (GUI RPC and HTTP)
        and this is the only form of sleep that it does.

        Change to the GUI_RPC and NET_XFER layers:
        instead of a poll() function, they now export

        get_fdset(): returns the set of descriptors in use
        got_select(): does I/O based on a set of active descriptors

    - Add new API calls:

        boinc_using_cpu()
        for apps that temporarily stop using the CPU
        (e.g. while doing network comm).
        Allows other apps to use CPU; treats app as if it were
        from a non-CPU-intensive project.

        Implementation: add non_cpu_intensive flag to ACTIVE_TASK.
        Copy from project initially.
        Use this instead of project.non_cpu_intensive for scheduling.
        Use app_state message channel to convey non_cpu_intensive

        boinc_need_network()
        boinc_network_poll()
        boinc_network_done()
        For apps that do network communication.
        If there is no physical connection (e.g. modem not dialed)
        this allows the app
        1) to request (via the core client and the BOINC manager)
        that the user establish a connection;
        2) to learn when a connection has been established
        3) to indicate that it is done with network comm
            (e.g. so we can hang up the modem)

        Implementation:
        Add want_network, have_network flags in API lib.
        Send want_network in app_status messages to core.
        Core: on network_available(), send <network_available/> to
        any app that wants network.

    Various changes for 3-part (major/minor/release) versions:
    - app_init_data.xml file and APP_INIT_DATA struct
        now have major/minor/release instead of core_version.
        This shouldn't break anything because nothing used
        core_version as far as I know.
    - added <core_client_release> element to state file,
        scheduler RPC requests, file upload handler requests.
    - GUI RPC requests now have major/minor/release instead of <version>
    - GUI RPC replies now have major/minor/release instead of encoded

    NOTE: there are a few places where version numbers are
    still being packed into integers using the major*100 + minor encoding:

        1) server min_core_client_version_announced mechanism
        2) server min_core_client_version mechanism
        3) wreq.core_client_version

    These are OK for now since they don't care about release,
    and we're not going to have minor versions > 99 in the near future.
    But at some point we should fix these.

        The existing (#results/2) definition has two problems:

        - adding one result at a time may be insufficient

    - validator: when find a canonical result, trigger the assimilator
        but do NOT trigger the transitioner; doing so creates a race condition.
        (from Bruce Allen)

        Example race condition (time ordered):
        transitioner [reads wu.assimilate_state==READY]                                                                     
                     ...(swapped out by process scheduler)
        assimilator  [reads wu.assimilate_state==READY]
                     does assimilation
                     [write wu.transition_time=NOW]
                     [write wu.assimilate_state=DONE]
        transitioner ...(swapped back in by process scheduler)
                     [writes wu.transition_time=MAX_INT]
        Final effect is wu.assimilate_state==DONE
                        wu.file_delete_state==INIT
                        wu.transition_time=MAX_INT
        This is wrong: one should have wu.transition_time=NOW
        else the WU will never change to file_delete_state=READY.

Bruce 10 Sept 2005
    - Web pages.  To control the posting of offensive pictures, do not
      display any user profile pictures until they have been verified by
      project admin.  When user enters or modifies picture, only they can
      see if.  If not yet verified, they will see a message saying that
      other users can't see it until it has been verified by the project.
      If admins have rejected it, user will see a message saying that they
      must replace their picture or no one but themselves can see it.
    - The only known side effect of this is that selection of UOTD is now
      done slightly differently by the uotd.inc functions.  Previously the only
      profiles with verification=1 were those with credit, so UOTD was
      selected from those.  Now there are profiles of users with zero credit
      that have verification=1.  So script that selects UOTD now does
      a table join to restrict profile searches to those of users with
      credit only.

    - Scheduler: if admin has set min_sendwork_interval in config file, then
      include a delay request at least this big in EVERY sched reply.  Else
      if the hardwired standard delay in the client is smaller than
      min_sendwork_interval, the client will keep getting connections
      refused at the server side.  David, please give this a glance.
    - Logging: to help resolve future race conditions etc, I have modified
      the logging functions to print fractional seconds down to hundred
      microsecond precision.  I think the only place that these logging
      functions are used is in the server back-end code and in error logging
      on the client side, where this should be OK. Rom, David, Charlie, if
      you are unhappy with client side effects, I'm sure there is a way
      to do this that only affects server side logging.

    - The acct_mgr_rpc() GUI RPC now has a corresponding
        acct_mgr_rpc_poll() GUI RPC.
        The BOINC manager should use this
        to find out when the RPC has finished,
        and whether it succeeded.

    NOTE: this eliminates the use of MSG_ALERT_ERROR and
    MSG_ALERT_INFO message types.
    We can take this code out of the Manager now.

    - Letting the OS cleanup instead of shutting things down ourselves is a bad idea,
        begin the process of cleaning up when shuting down so that things don't
        disappear in random places.
        
      Basically the OS would free the heap before the graphics thread had shutdown
        when the machine was under load, this causes C0000005 errors since the
        pointers no longer point to memory that we own.

    - Mac: Trim garbage off end of symbols in backtrace.
    - Fixed backtracing through signal handler.  This required 
      determining the correct offset within sigtramp's stack 
      frame of the pointer to the next stack frame; this varies
      among major versions of the macintosh OS.  I'm confident 
      I have the correct value for OS 10.3, but three different 
      offsets all contained the correct value in my tests on 
      OS 10.4, so I'm less confident there.

      between open/close tags, not just the text between the opening tag
      and the next "<" sign.

    - feeder: add an -allapps option.
        This causes the feeder to get equal numbers of
        results from all applications.
        (The default behavior is that it gets results in
        whatever order the DB returns them in,
        which could give you lots of results for 1 app
        before getting around to another one).
        (from Carl Christensen)

    NOTE: this enumerates the application table every
    time the work enumeration restarts - redundant.
    It would be better to pass in the application info
    from the feeder (which knows it already, it's in shared mem)

    - Improve the client's file transfer backoff logic.
        Old: separate backoff for each file.
            Suppose a client has 10 results from a project,
            each with 5 input files, and server is down.
            It will try all 50 downloads, they all back off a minute,
            it tries all 50 again, etc.
            This is bad, especially if the download server
            is up but overloaded.
        New: maintain per-project backoff parameters as well
            (separate for upload/download directions).
            If a project gets 3 consecutive UL or DL failures,
            it goes into a random-exponential-length period
            of "project backoff" during which no transfers are started.
            During this period, individual file backoffs continue to accumulate,
            so that retries will be widely spread out when the client
            emerges from project backoff
            (this is a kludge, and hard to understand,
            but I can't think of a simpler way off the top of my head)

    - Fix problems with disk space management code, which can cause
        - violation of user disk usage prefs
        - server sends clients lots of results
            even though client has zero free disk space,
            and results will immediately error out.
        OLD:
            client: scheduler requests include disk space info
                (d_total and d_free),
                but they're the values at client startup,
                which may be way out of date!
                (e.g. free space may now be zero)
            server:
                Expected <total_disk_usage> in request message.
                This was removed a long time ago.
                The formula for computing max additional disk usage was wrong.
        NEW:
            client: scheduler requests includes
                - up-to-date values for d_total and d_free
                - up-to-date values for BOINC and project disk usage:
                    <d_boinc_used_total>, <d_boinc_used_project>
            server:
                Parse new scheduler request fields.
                If new fields are present,
                calculate max additional disk usage based on them.
    - Change to scheduler RPC requests:
        OLD:
            <resource_share_fraction> is sent, but it's actually
            potentially runnable resource share fraction.
            (Didn't matter; it's not currently used by server)
        NEW:
            <resource_share_fraction> (total resource share fraction)
            <rrs_fraction> (runnable resource share fraction)
            <prrs_fraction> (potentially runnable resource share fraction)
            ... are all sent.
            Future versions of the server may use them for
            disk and/or CPU allocation>
    - Commented out or deleted some unused code, e.g. all references to
        p_fpop_err, p_iop_err, p_membw_err

    NOTES:
        1) If old client talks to new server,
            only the "min free" preference will be enforced.
        2) If old or new client talks to old server,
            no preferences are reliably enforced
        3) If new client talks to new server,
            all preferences are enforced,
            BUT project resource shares are not enforced.
            E.g. one project might hog all the disk space
            even though it's resource share is small and
            other projects need space.
            Need to figure out how to address this.

        There are now two ways to create an account
        1) via client
            - Enter email and password in BOINC manager
            - BOINC manager eventually brings up account_finish.php,
                which asks you for name/country/zip.
        2) via web
            - Enter email/password/name/country/zip in one form

        Both paths leave you at the "Your account" page,
        with some extra text at the beginning,
        telling you to set your preferences,
        and (in case 2) to make sure you've downloaded the client software.

David  13 Oct 2005
    - Fix a moderate security loophole in GUI RPC.
        Old: by default, core client doesn't create a password file
            (gui_rpc_auth.cfg).
            Therefore any process on the local host can connect to it;
            even processes belonging to other users.
            So if user X is running BOINC, evil user Y can use GUI
            RPCs to attach BOINC to a rogue project,
            causing bad code to run as user X.
        New: on startup, if the core client doesn't find a password file,
            it creates one, writes a long random string to it,
            and (on Unix) makes it user-read/write only.
            The BOINC Manager, when connecting to the local host,
            looks for a password file in the current directory.

        Bottom line: a user running BOINC is now protected against
        other users on the same host.

        NOTE: this could cause some angst for Mac users,
        if they expect things to work the same for all users.

        I also checked in a script, credit_study.php,
        that samples various values for fp_benchmark_weight
        and computes the variance in claimed credit that each one produces
        (based on results currently in the DB).

    - Addendum to yesterday's checkin.
        It turns out that, on average, the int benchmark
        is twice the FP benchmark.
        So if a project were to set its fp_benchmark_weight to 1,
        the average credit per CPU second would decrease by 1/3.
        Similarly it would increase if fp_benchmark_weight were 0.

        To fix this, I added a scaling factor that maintains a
        constant average credit per CPU second
        (the same average as the current 50/50 weighting)
        regardless of fp_benchmark_weight.

    - user web: the line
    
        $profile->verification = 0;

        in profile.inc prevented anyone from creating a new profile
        with a picture.
        This is because the $profile argument  process_create_result()
        is null iff it's a new profile.
        The above assignment makes $profile not null,
        which screws up the logic.

    - Moved some layout information out of the HTML forum files and into
      the CSS file. This allows for far more flexibility when defining a
      custom layout and colourscheme for the forums.
      You should even be able to use nice background images for the bars etc.
      Theoretically all or most layout information should be outside 
      the HTML instead of hardcoded into it...

      The text is now centered instead and the bottom options stays where
      they are.

    - Sched fix from Walt Gribben: have scheduler defaults for disk
      space prefs agree with web page.  Bruce's note: this may require
      further fixes for two cases.  First, if the project prefs are
      not the same as BOINC defaults.  Second, if the user doesn't want
      BOINC to leave any disk space free and on their web preference page
      sets 'leave X bytes free' to zero, then this patch will assume they
      mean 100MB.  But I'm still applying the patch 'cause Walt says that
      this is keeping lots of new users from getting work.

    - A bunch of changes to make the core client work on OS/2
        Also a couple of small bug fixes.
        (from Yuri Dario).

        Note: this is done using #define __EMX__
        (apparently that's a symbol defined in OS/2 compiles).
        This goes against our convention of using configure,
        but it looks like OS/2 is sufficiently different (like Windows)
        so that this is the easiest way to do it.
        Anyway, changes are fairly limited.

    - Added a script that maintains a set of sanatized scheduler logs
      for users, helpers, and admins to view on the web.
    - A second script removes these log files if more than one week
      old.
    - The logs are 'sanatized' by removing IP addresses and authenticators.
    - These scripts should be controlled by using the standard start/stop
      scripts.  To do this, make entries in config.xml.  The files both
      contain comments at the top detailing how to do this.

	- New autoconf macro "BOINC_PLATFORM" to determine the BOINC platform
	  being targeted.  This overrides the use of the autoconf target as the
	  BOINC platform.  I recommend that people developing BOINC 
	  applications use this macro as well in their autoconf scripts.
	  This macro can be overridden with the --with-boinc-platform=
	  option to configure.

	  Some of the platform modifications made in this script are...

	  = *-redhat-* -> *-pc-*
	  = *-*-*[0-9].[0-9] -> *-*-*  (trailing version numbers are dropped)
	  = sparc-sun-solaris -> sparc64-sun-solaris when compiled as 64 bit

	  = x86_64-*-linux-gnu -> i686-pc-linux-gnu when compiled as a 32 bit
	    binary
        - New autoconf macro "BOINC_CHECK_CYGWIN" to give people who need to
	  modify their configure script to work with CYGWIN a place to do their
	  work.  Right now the only thing done here is to check whether to use
	  the Windows GUI or X11.  Graphical compiles under CYGWIN currently
	  do not function due to both __unix__ and _WIN32 being defined.

	- Various changes to account manager handling in response
		to conversation with GridRepublic.
		Allowing operations (attach/detach/suspend/resume)
		to be done from either web or GUI creates big
		synchronization problems.
		So we adopt the basic principle:
		suspend/resume is done only from GUI;
		attach/detach is done only from web.
	- Account manager RPC is done by POST instead of GET;
		arguments are now in XML,
		and include a list of AM-attached projects
		Note: you can access POST info from PHP as "php://input"
	- remove suspend-related stuff from acct mgr reply
	- debug the repeat_sec mechanism.
	- Maintain project.attached_via_acct_mgr;
		keeps track of whether this project was originally
		attached in response to an account manager RPC,
		or is identical to one such.
		Don't allow such projects to be detached via GUI.

	NOTE: if user tries to detach an acct-mgr-attached project,
	the error message appears in the Messages tab.
	It should appear as an error dialog.

    - Add a security mechanism that limits the damage if hackers
        break into an account manager server or do a man-in-the-middle attack.

        The attack: hackers break into an account manager and modify
        it so that RPC replies include accounts on malicious projects.

        The protection:
        1) account manager replies now include a "signing key".
        This is stored on the client in the account manager URL file.
        
        2) If the client has a signing key for an account manager and
        receives a different one, it ignores it and prints an error message.

        3) Each account in an account manager reply includes a "URL signature",
        which is the URL signed with the signing key.
        The client ignores any URLs with missing or bad signatures.

        Note: users who sign up with the account manager after it's hacked
        are not protected by this
        (same as for BOINC project code download protection).

    - To address some concerns about security, strip USER # from the
      online scheduler logs.  The only info that appears in these
      online logs is then the HOSTID.  If the user has chosen to hide
      their hosts, then there is no way to figure out which user a
      given hostid belongs to.

      Note that this is exactly the same as the current approach of
      displaying the results by hostid, but hiding the identity of the
      user who owns a given host.

      Also, increase default time for retaining logs to two weeks.

    - Change the network suspend/resume logic so that the
        "idle while user active" and "idle if on batteries"
        preferences are ignored for 5 minutes GUI RPCs.
        This means that if the user has one of these preferences,
        and attaches to a project,
        they'll generally get the initial result download
        from the project before the network is suspended.

    - add <guid> elements to RSS items and make the <link>s unique.
        Apparently this is needed by some RSS readers.
        
    NOTE: for this to take effect,
        project will need to check out the following files,
        then rename sample_rss_main.php to rss_main.php

    - Nasty bug fix to sched. escape_string() replaces \ by \\ and
      ' by \'.  This makes the string longer.  To guarantee that the
      resulting longer string does not overflow storage, escape_string()
      uses safe_strncpy() to copy the longer string back.  But this
      is too heavy-handed, since safe_strncpy() will blindly truncate
      the string.  Thus it might clobber \\ into \ or \' into \ which
      causes trouble.

      David, Rom, please double-check my changes, since escape_string()
      is used all over the place.
