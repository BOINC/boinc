# Script to execute googletest based unit tests for BOINC

# Usage:
#  ./tests/executeUnitTests.sh [--report-coverage] [--clean]
#
# if --report-coverage is given the test coverage will be reported to codecov.io
# if --clean is given the tests will be rebuild from scratch otherwise an existing
# build directory is used

# check working directory because the script needs to be called like: ./tests/executeUnitTests.sh
