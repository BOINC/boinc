    - client: scheduling problem:
        - a project overestimates job FLOP counts
        - the client starts jobs in EDF mode
        - as job progresses and fraction done increases,
            its completion time estimate decreases until
            it's no longer a deadline miss.
        - job gets preempted by other job from that project;
            you end up with lots of partly completed jobs.
        Solution (I hope): if an app version has running jobs,
            compute a "temp DCF" for the app version,
            which is the min of dynamic/static estimates for its jobs.
            Apply this scaling factor to completion time estimates
            for unstarted jobs in RR simulation
    - client: the estimation of remaining time of running jobs was wrong
        (how did this bug survive so long?)

    - client: Eliminate x86_64 Mac client; i386 client determines if

        platform accordingly.  This allows us to link with the 32-bit

    - API: if app can't acquire lock file, tell the client not
        to restart app for 10 minutes.
        Hopefully what will happen is:
        - another instance of app is running in slot dir
            (shouldn't happen, but sometimes does)
        - that app will eventually finish, and will write
            a checkpoint file saying so.
            It will call boinc_finish(0), but the client won't notice
            that it has exited.
        - the next time the client starts the app,
            it will acquire lock, see that it's done,
            and call boinc_finish(0).
            This time the client will notice,
            and the job will be reported as correct.
        The downside to all this is that the client won't know
        that the CPU is in use, and will schedule NCPUS jobs.

        This introduces the possibility of "holes" in the seqno space.
        In order that the manager learns of these deletions,
        we use the following mechanism:
        whenever a notice is removed (because it's a dup or too old)
        a flag is set in each GUI_RPC_CONN.
        On the next get_notice() RPC, the client returns the entire
        list of notices, preceded by a dummy notice with seqno=-1;
        this tells the RPC stub function to replace the current list
        rather than appending to it.

    - Mac Sandbox: The init_data.xml file in each slot directory also contains 
        an authenticator; to keep these private, change ownership of the "slots" 
        directory to boinc_master:boinc_project and eliminate read and execute 
        permissions of this directory for "other".  For consistency, make the 
        same changes to the "projects" directory.  The individual slot and 
        project directories are still world-executable and they and their 
        contents are still world-readable, so the Client can still read files 
        created by project apps with ownership boinc_project:boinc_project.
      - NOTE: I believe this should not cause any problems for either BOINC or 
        project applications, but it needs to be tested thoroughly.

        The current architecture makes it difficult to do otherwise.

    - various components: fix inconsistencies in how user names
        and team names are represented.
        In particular, edit_user_info_action.php was using
        htmlentities() on names; this led to double-encoding.

        The new rules:
        1) no HTML tags allowed in either one.
            This is enforced silently, using strip_tags()
        2) names are stored in the DB exactly as entered.
            They may contain chars like & and >.
            They may contain non-ASCII characters
            (use UTF-8 if you want them displayed correctly).
            None of these are not escaped.
        3) When the names are put in XML
            (e.g. in scheduler reply or db_dump output)
            they are XML-escaped.
            This escapes <, &, and non-ASCII chars
        4) The client leaves them in this form,
            and writes them that way in GUI RPCs
            and init_data.xml files.
        5) The parsing of GUI RPC replies and init_data.xml files
            XML-unescapes them.

        To work around this bug, the dialog had been made resizeable and the 
        height and width were saved in the Manager settings.  But this meant 
        that when we add an item to the dialog, it is too small until the 
        user expands it.  And Modal dialogs like this should not be resizeable.
        I also made the dialog no longer resizeable by the user.

        parsing the POST reply.

    - server: various changes;
        see http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/wiki/CreditNew

        Projects will need to update DB and recompile all back-end programs.

        Summary:
        - new way of computing credit
        - "reliable host" mechanism is per app version
        - "host punishment" mechanism is per app version
        - adjustment of wu.rsc_fpops_est provides the
            equivalent of per app version DCF
        - max jobs in progress is now per app
        - max jobs per RPC is now per app

        TODO:
        - reliable mechanism:
            - populate and use host_app_version.error_rate
            - populate host_app_version.turnaround
        - host punishment:
            - populate host_app_version.max_jobs_per_day
            - populate host_app_version.n_jobs_today
            - use app.max_jobs_per_day_init
        - job limits:
            - use app.max_jobs_in_progress, max_gpu_jobs_in_progress
            - use app.max_jobs_per_rpc
        - adjust wu.rsc_fpops_est
        - remove old credit stuff
            fpops_cumulative, credit_multiplier

    - backend programs: change the way PFC and elapsed-time statistics
        are written to the DB.
        The incremental approach was bogus.
        New approach:
        host_app_version: write directly; R/W interval is tiny
        app_version: maintain an explicit list of update samples
            for both PFC and credit.
            When the validator flushes its app_version cache,
            do careful updates.
        Note: when using double fields in careful updates,
        you can't test for equality.  Use abs(new-old) < 1e-N

    - scheduler and validator: distinguish between
        1) peak FLOPS (based on benchmarks or GPU attributes).
            This does not change over time.
            It's not adjusted on the basis of statistics.
            It's not affected by wu.rsc_fpops_est.
            It can be compared across projects.
        versus
        2) projected FLOPS: the scheduler's best guess as to what will satisfy
            X * elapsed_time = wu.rsc_fpops_est;
            this is used to make server-side runtime estimates,
            and it's sent to the client and used for its runtime estimates.
            It may be based on the (host, app version) elapsed time average.
        My checkin [21153] mistakently confounded these two.

        Notes:
        1) app_plan() now must return both peak and projected FLOPS.
        2) result.flops_estimate stores peak FLOPS
        3) the <flops> field in app_info.xml files should be
            projected FLOPS.  But its accuracy is not important;
            it's not used once the server has statistics
            for the (host, app version)

    - server: change the following from per-host to per-(host, app version):
        - daily quota mechanism
        - reliable mechanism (accelerated retries)
        - "trusted" mechanism (adaptive replication)
    - scheduler: enforce host scale probation only for apps with
        host_scale_check set.
    - validator: do scale probation on invalid results
        (need this in addition to error and timeout cases)
    - feeder: update app version scales every 10 min, not 10 sec
    - back-end apps: support --foo as well as -foo for options

    Notes:
    - If you have, say, cuda, cuda23 and cuda_fermi plan classes,
        a host will have separate quotas for each one.
        That means it could error out on 100 jobs for cuda_fermi,
        and when its quota goes to zero,
        error out on 100 jobs for cuda23, etc.
        This is intentional; there may be cases where one version
        works but not the others.
    - host.error_rate and host.max_results_day are deprecated

    TODO:
        - the values in the app table for limits on jobs in progress etc.
            should override rather than config.xml.

    Implementation notes:
    scheduler:
        process_request():
            read all host_app_versions for host at start;
            Compute "reliable" and "trusted" for each one.
            write modified records at end
        get_app_version():
            add "reliable_only" arg; if set, use only reliable versions
            skip over-quota versions
        Multi-pass scheduling: if have at least one reliable version,
            do a pass for jobs that need reliable,
            and use only reliable versions.
            Then clear best_app_versions cache.
        Score-based scheduling: for need-reliable jobs,
            it will pick the fastest version,
            then give a score bonus if that version happens to be reliable.
        When get back a successful result from client:
            increase daily quota
        When get back an error result from client:
            impose scale probation
            decrease daily quota if not aborted
    Validator:
        when handling a WU, create a vector of HOST_APP_VERSION
            parallel to vector of RESULT.
            Pass it to assign_credit_set().
            Make copies of originals so we can update only modified ones
        update HOST_APP_VERSION error rates

    - back end: new way of deciding:
        - whether host is "reliable" for an app version
        - whether host is eligible for single replication for an app version
        - whether to use host scaling
        In each case, the answer is yes if the number of
        consecutive valid results is above a threshold.
        This replaces existing "error rate" and "scale probation" mechanisms.

        TODO: the # of consecutive valid results should also determine
            a limit on jobs in progress for an app version.
            Namely, if N is the threshold for host scaling, the limit should be
                ndevices*(max(1, consecutive_valid - N))
            The client currently doesn't supply enough
            app version info to do this.
            It could be approximated; that would give some protection
            against cherry-picking.
    - credit: more conservative formulas for combining claimed credit
        among replicas.
        If there are normal replicas, we use a "low average"
        that weights each sample by the sum of the other samples.
        Otherwise we use the min (not the average) of the approximate samples.

    - client: fix bug with NVIDIA GPUs.
        Some of them allow only 1 CUDA context at a time.
        You need to create a CUDA context to get available VRAM.
        So the client would run a CUDA job, then immediately kill it.
        Solution:
        - If a GPU app is running,
            let it keep running regardless of available VRAM
            (if it's still running, it has enough VRAM).
        - But don't start new apps if there's not enough available VRAM,
            or it the amount is unknown
            (if the client can't create a CUDA context,
            the app won't be able to either)
    - client: if <coproc_debug> is set, print available GPU RAM periodically

	- client: clear config before rereading config file.

    - scheduler: changeset 21148 broke the scheduler.
        We store pointers to BEST_APP_VERSION in both APP_VERSION and RESULT.
        We can't then fiddle with the vector that these point into.
        Switch back to using a vector of pointers.
        This restores the memory leak, which I'll deal with later.

    - client and scheduler RPC:
        Add more info to "project in-progress job list".
        Old: entries included only job name and app plan class;
            this was used to resend lost jobs,
            and to count the # of CPU and GPU jobs.
            But it's not usable e.g. for per-app in-progress limits.
        New: send the client's app versions (including usage info)
            and for each in-progress job, which app version it uses.
            (This reduces request-message size compared with sending
            usage info and app name per job).
    - client and scheduler RPC:
        Add more info to "all in-progress job list", and make it optional.
        This list is used by schedulers that do deadline checks
        using EDF workload simulation.
        Old: the list is always sent, and it contains no info
            about job resource usage
        New: the list is sent only if the scheduler asked for it
            in a previous reply,
            and each entry now contains resource usage (CPU, GPUs)
        Note: the scheduler's EDF simulator is outdated;
            it doesn't know about GPU jobs.
            But we may as well get the info in place.
