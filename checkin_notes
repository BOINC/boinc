    - VBOX: If VirtualBox reports an error snag both the hypervisor system
        log as well as the VM execution log.  Maybe the hypervisor log
        will tell us what is up with the virtual floppy device.
    - VBOX: Don't retry commands that are expected to fail in normal use
        cases.  It slows down getting the VM up and running.
    - VBOX: After starting the VM, use a timed loop waiting for the initial
        VM state change instead of just waiting for 5 seconds.  Older
        machines can take longer than 5 seconds to switch from poweroff
        to starting.  If we hit the main poll loop in that state the wrapper
        thinks we have crashed.
    - VBOX: Strip carriage returns from all the vboxmanage output on
        Windows.

        Weird stuff happens when people start/stop BOINC quickly,
        it looks as though the previous VM instance isn't shutdown before we

Charlie 20 Jan 2012
    - OpenCL: 
        Problem: Mac OpenCL does not recognize all NVIDIA GPUs returned 
        by CUDA.  Since there is no CAL for Mac, this is not an issue 
        for ATI / AMD GPUs.  On other platforms, the CUDA and CAL drivers 
        also provide OpenCL support, so we don't expect the problem there.
    
        Solution: I believe that CUDA and OpenCL return identical GPU 
        model names for the same GPU, and that both return the GPUs in the 
        same order (but with some possibly omitted from the OpenCL sequence.)
        We use that information to correlate the OpenCL data with CUDA data. 
        We use our internal CUDA device_num for the corresponding OpenCL 
        device, but add a new field opencl_device_index; the two fields are 
        equal unless we have CUDA devices not recognized by OpenCL.  We 
        add a new array opencl_device_indexes[] to the COPROC struct, 
        corresponding to the entries in device_nums[].
    
        The init_data.xml file now has a new field gpu_opencl_device_index.  
        If this field exists, the boinc_get_opencl_ids() API uses this to 
        find the cl_device_id and cl_platform_id, otherwise it continues 
        to use the value in gpu_device_num.

    - client: add a mechanism for restartable download of compressed files.
        (It turns out that the compression schemes supported by
        Apache and libcurl, suprisingly, aren't restartable.)

        if a <file_info> from the server contains <gzipped_url> tags,
        use those instead of the <url> tags,
        and flag the file as "download_gzipped".
        If this is the case, download NAME.gz and save it as NAME.gzt.
        When the download is complete, rename NAME.gzt to NAME.gz,
        and uncompress it to NAME.
        (this ensures that if NAME.gz is present, it's complete).
        Also do the uncompression, if needed, in verify_file().
        This ensures that the uncompression will eventually get done
        even if the client quits are crashes in the middle.

    - update_versions: if <gzip> is present in a <file_info>,
        add a gzipped copy in the download directory
        and add a <gzipped_url> elements to the app version's xml_doc.

    - server: revamp the "assigned job" mechanism.
        This now supports two main use cases:
        1) there's a job that you want to run once on all hosts,
            present and future
            (or all hosts belonging to a user, or to a team).
            The job is never transitioned, validated, or assimilated.
        2) There's a normal job for which you want to use only
            hosts belonging to a specific user (e.g. cluster or cloud hosts).
            This restriction can be made either when the job is created,
            or on the fly,
            e.g. as part of a scheme for accelerating batch completion.
            For the latter purposes we now provide a function
                restrict_wu_to_user(DB_WORKUNIT&, int userid);

            The job goes through the standard
            transitioner/validator/assimilator path.

        These cases are enabled by config flags
            <enable_assignment_multi/>
            <enable_assignment/>
        respectively.

        Assignment of type 2) are no longer stored in shared mem,
        so there is no limit on their number.

        There is no longer a rule that assigned job names must contain "asgn".

        NOTE: this requires a database update.

    - client: fix job scheduler problem:
        old: RR simulation marks some jobs as missing their deadline,
            and the job scheduler runs those jobs as "high priority".
        problem: those generally aren't the ones we should run.
            E.g. if the client has a lot of jobs from a project,
            typically the ones with later deadlines are the ones
            whose deadlines are missed in the simulation.
            But in this case the EDF policy says we should run
            the ones with earliest deadlines.
        new: if a project has N deadline misses,
            run its N earliest-deadline jobs,
            regardless of whether they missed their deadline in the sim.
        Note: this is how it used to be (as designed by John McLeod).

    - client: change the job scheduling policy for MT jobs.
        The old policy avoided running an N-CPU job unless N CPUs were free.
        This could result in idle CPUs for long periods; for example:
        on a 4-CPU machine, suppose you have a long 1-CPU job in EDF mode,
        and some 4-CPU jobs.
        3 CPUs will be idle until the 1-CPU job finishes.
        Furthermore, the work fetch mechanism won't try to get
        jobs (possibly non-MT) from other projects,
        because the RR simulation doesn't reflect the scheduling
        policy's exclusion principle.

        The change: schedule jobs until ncpus_used >= ncpus.
        E.g. in the above situation run the 1- and 4-CPU jobs together.
        In extreme cases we might run 3 1-CPU jobs and the 4-CPU job.
        This will degrade the performance of the 4-CPU job,
        but that's probably better than having idle CPUs.

    - scheduler and create_work: fix bugs that caused targeted jobs
        to be sent to non-targeted hosts.
        The feeder was erroneously putting targeted jobs
        in the shared mem cache.
        Changes:
        - The feeder only enumerates jobs for which
            workunit.transitioner_flags is zero.
            NOTE: this field is nonzero iff the job is assigned.
        - create_work: when creating an assigned jobs,
            set workunit.transitioner_flags appropriately

David  24 Feb 2012
    - scheduler: when choosing the best app version,
        by default we skip app versions that use a resource
        for which work has not been requested.
        This is determined by the "check_req" arg to get_app_version().
        This flag is cleared whenever we want to send a job
        regardless of whether a requested resource can be used:
        namely, when resending lost jobs, and when sending assigned jobs.

        Fix a bug that could skip unrequested versions even
        when check_req is false.

        NOTES:

        1) The current semantics aren't right.
        When check_req is false, we selected the fastest of all app versions,
        including those for which no work is requested.
        Instead, we should select the fastest of the versions
        for which work is requested if there are any;
        otherwise, select the fastest version.

        2) The mechanism isn't implemented for anonymous platform.
        It should be.

        3) If we've cached an answer (including NULL) for a given
        value of check_req, that answer may be wrong for a different value.

        to the project config (in config.xml) for each such userid.

Bernd  27 Feb 2012
    - scheduler: the scheduler (stderr) log is buffered to keep the output of
        one instance together in the scheduler.log when multiple instances are
        running. Currently the buffer has a fixed size of 32768 charaters.
        On one hand with much debug output this buffer may turn out to be
        too small. OTOH the log of this instance is completely lost in case
        of a crash, which doesn't help with debugging. Thus make the
        scheduler log buffer size configurable using the tag
        <scheduler_log_buffer> in project config. The default value is
        still the old size (32768), set it to 0 to disable buffering
        completely, e.g. for debugging.

Bernd  27 Feb 2012
    - scheduler: Another feature for debugging the scheduler.
        Previously (little known) the scheduler could be hacked to preserve
        the sched_request.xml and sched_reply.xml in own directories
        (you had to modify the initial value of use_files in sched_main.cpp).
        This feature could now be switched on and off on the fly just by
        changing the project config.
        When there is an (existing) directory configured as
        <debug_req_reply_dir>, each schduler instance will write three
        files in there: PID_C_sched.log, PID_C_sched_request.xml and (if all
        goes well) PID_C_sched_reply.xml. PID is the process id of this
        scheduler instance, C is an internal counter within the process if
        FCGI is used. The sched.log will contain nothing else than the
        pid and the IP address of the client. This should allow for
        identifying the scheduler instance responsible for a given
        apache error log message ("premature end of script headers") when
        a scheduler crashed. sched_request.xml (obviously) is the scheduler
        request, and if the scheduler doesn't crash in between, there will
        also be the reply to the client kept in sched_reply.xml
        Remove the <debug_req_reply_dir> tag from the project config
        to turn this feature off.

    - client: Increase the quit request timeout from 10 seconds to 60 seconds for
        machines running VMs and slow disk drives.  It should give the VM enough
        time to gracefully shutdown and not give boinc reason to kill the wrapper.

            if there are several EDF jobs and several non-EDF GPU jobs.
        - don't overcommit CPUs if any job is MT (MT means avg_ncpus > 1).
            For example, on a 4-CPU machine we will run:
                a 0.5-CPU GPU job and 4 1-CPU jobs
                but not

        - Perform snapshots at most once every ten minutes.
        - Client suspend/resume messages behave the same.
        - Client no heartbeat/quit messages cause the wrapper to just
          poweroff the VM.
    
        On startup check to see if the last checkpoint time is greater than 0,
        if so, start from the most recent snapshot.
    - VBOX: If we receieve the status message of no heartbeat or quit, set
        the temporary delay to 5 minutes.  If the wrapper is terminated during
        the middle of a snapshot, hopefully this will give VirtualBox enough
        time to complete the snapshot.  Restarting the BOINC job should then
        poweroff the VM and restore from the last snapshot.

        <in_progress_dur> are in wall time, not run time
        (i.e. scale them by availability)

    Note: there's some confusion in the code between runtime and wall time,
        where in general wall time = runtime / availability.
        New convention: let's use "runtime" for the former,
        and "duration" for the latter.

        While parsing the scheduler reply we'd add FILE_REFs to
        PROJECT::project_files,
        but wouldn't link them to FILE_INFOs since this is done
        only if the reply parses correctly.
        The next garbage_collect() would dereference these NULL pointers.

        Solution: parse the FILE_REFS into SCHEDULER_REPLY::project_files.
        Copy this to PROJECT::project_files only if the reply parses.

    - A first attempt to fix the bug where apps die with exit(1)
        (whereas they didn't do this w/ older clients).
        On Windows, the client uses TerminateProcess(h, 1) to kill processes;
        the 1 is the exit code the process will appear to have.

        So instead, add a "will_restart" bool arg to the various kill
        functions, and if set use 0 (= STATUS_SUCCESS),
        otherwise use EXIT_ABORTED_BY_CLIENT.

        Note: in principle this shouldn't make any difference
        for quitting tasks,
        since handle_exited_app() checks for task state QUIT_PENDING
        and ignores the exit code in that case.
        The only place I can see where it would make any difference
        is when we kill a process because it hasn't been handling
        queued shared-memory messages for 180 seconds.

    - client: add more info to the message about an exited app

    - client: function return values (ERR_*) are different from
        process exit codes (EXIT_*).
        But in many places we were using return values as exit codes.
        Fix these.
        Also, break out the different types of limits a job can exceed
        (time, disk, memory) into difference exit codes.

    - lib: Keep track of the rough estimate of stdout and stderr by
        incrementing internal variables instead of doing a stat on
        each log write.  stat() on Windows is converted to a FindFirstFile()
        call which in turn looks up the file size information in the
        directory structure file system entry.  The directory structure 
        information is only updated periodically.  This lead to larger
        than expected log file for both the manager and core client.
        
        This has the added advantage of reducing the overall number of
        file I/O operations when logging information.

    - scheduler: moved client version check to be last of the checks
        performed for a particular app version. It is not necessary
        to tell the user to upgrade the client just to suite the needs of
        a particular app version if this app version requires resources
        that the host dosn't have or didn't request work for.

        Actually I don't think it's good to tell the user he needs to
        upgrade the client if there is only one particular app version
        that requires a more recent one than he has. I think that the
        purpose of the g_wreq->outdated_client flag was checking the
        min_core_version in the project configuration. For this the 
        flag and the notice/message that it triggers is still ok. But
        in the app version checks setting this flag leads to misleading
        messages in most cases, so I commented that out for now.

        I'm not sure, though, that both of these measurements are needed.
