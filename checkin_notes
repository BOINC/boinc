    Initial checkin of all files.
    The system is fairly feature-complete and
    runs a number of test cases correctly.
    Currently runs only on Linux.

    - Got things to compile on Solaris.
    - Pass in platform name, version number from Makefile
        (platform name comes from configure)

    - Allow applications to have multiple files
        (e.g. scripts, libraries, pre- and post-processing programs).
        The app_version table now has an xml_doc field,
        which contains a list of <file_info> and <file_ref> elements.
        Note: the utility for adding applications (tools/add.C)
        still handles only single-file applications.
    - Changed IO_FILE_DESC to FILE_REF since it now represents
        an association of a file to workunit, result or application

    - Change the scheduling server to reduce database accesses.
        There's now a shared-memory segment that contains
        1) the platform, app, and app_version tables in their entirety;
        2) a fixed-size set of results ready to be sent,
            and their corresponding workunit.
        This segment is initialized and maintained by a new program
        called the "feeder" (sched/feeder.C) that should run
        whenever the scheduling server is up.
        Note: the scheduler still needs to be converted to fast CGI
    - Added handy interfaces for dealing with shared memory and semaphores.
    - Changed to utilities and scripts used for testing so that all
        server-specific names (paths and URLs) come from environment
        variables instead of being hardwired in the code.
        You'll want to add these to your .tcshrc or whatever.
        See the doc/install.html for details.

        files db/dependencies and client/config.status and client/config.log
                removed.  These are build time files and should not belong
                in the source tree.  They confuse subsequent builds.
        files updated: configure configure.in api/Makefile.in
                apps/Makefile.in client/Makefile.in db/Makefile.in
                db/mysql.h lib/Makefile.in sched/Makefile.in
                tools/Makefile.in

        These Makefile.in changes will allow the build to be performed
        outside the source tree.  This is convenient for several
        reasons.  The number one reason is that this allows the source
        tree to remain untouched by the build and therefore clean.
        This will prevent garbage build files from being checked in
        during a 'cvs commit'

        To run a build outside the source tree, simply make an object
        directory anywhere else that you would like to work, then just
        execute the configure script in the top-level boinc directory.
                $ mkdir boincobj
                $ cd boincobj
                $ <... path to source tree ...>/boinc/configure
                $ make > make.out 2>&1 &

        Note the examples in apps/Makefile.in and sched/Makefile.in
        of how to use the top_srcdir variable to locate include files
        in the source tree outside of the current directory.  Local
        references to other object files and libraries produced by
        the build remain as local .. references.

        The change to configure.in, (and thus configure) and db/mysql.h
        allow a proper identification of where the mysql .h files live.
        The SSL location of /usr/local/mysql/include is a bit non-standard.
        Most systems will have these in /usr/local/include/mysql

        apps/Makefile.in client/Makefile.in client/config.guess
        client/configure client/configure.in sched/Makefile.in
        tools/Makefile.in

        I have almost clean builds now on Solaris, Mac OS X,
        and UnixWare.  There appears to be a missing sched_shmem.h
        file from the source tree.

        There is still cruft in this configure system.  I will continue
        to work on it to clean it up.

    - Mostly implemented support for editing preferences,
        including project-specific preferences.
        Simplified the preferences scheme.
        Abandoned the idea of multiple preference sets per user;
        each user now has a single set of preferences.
        Got rid of the "prefs" database table;
        prefs are now just an XML and mod_time field in the user table.
        Haven't tested much yet.

    NOTE: these new features use the XML parsing features of PHP.
    This means that, on the BOINC web server,
    you must configure PHP with the --with-xml option,
    and you must make and install Apache.
    Also, you probably need to use a recent version of PHP;
    XML parsing was broken in PHP 4.0.4, but it works in 4.2.1.

        updating: client/configure client/configure.in
        client/net_xfer.C sched/Makefile.in sched/feeder.C

        This now builds just fine on Solaris, Linux and OpenUnix8.
        And only two tiny errors remain for a Mac OS X build.
        That being the specification of g++ in the sched/Makefile
        and statvfs() is not available on the Mac for
        the client/hostinfo_unix.C compile.  Need a substitute for
        that function on the Mac.

    - Ensure that preferences propagate from the server
        where they are updated to all hosts,
        Eliminated concept of "home project".
        Not tested yet.
        Also to do: replace the "accounts.xml" file with
        a file containing preferences.
    - Changed the way the client handles preferences.
        It now saves saves the exact XML it gets from the server,
        regardless of whether it can parse it all.
    - Fixed client parsing code to reflect new names for preferences
    - Changed the way the scheduling server handles prefs in
        a client/server interaction.
        If it gets newer prefs, it updates its own DB.
        If its DB has newer prefs, it sends them to client.
    - Fixed the test scripts so that they start/stop the feeder also.
        This required adding a "ready" flag to the shared-mem structure
        so that the scheduling server can find out if the feeder hasn't
        finished initializing the structure.
        Also required adding a "-synch" cmdline option to feeder.
    - added utility program (sched/show_shmem.C) for looking at
        scheduler shared memory
    - renamed "types.*" to "client_types.*" to avoid name conflict
        with system include files

    - added support for multiple URLs in a FILE_INFO
        (e.g. multiple servers from which the file can be downloaded)
    - started work on "persistent file transfer": a layer on top of
        FILE_XFER that manages restarting from failed connections,
        and that implements a give-up policy
    - added offset arguments to GET and PUT HTTP operations.
        NOTE: this will work fine for downloading files (GET)
        but we'll have to use something else for upload,
        since the standard PUT handler doesn't do offsets,
        and we need security functionality in any case.
    - added preliminary version of application API for
        communicating with core client.
    - use <file_ref> tags instead of <input_file> and <output_file>
        (makes things simpler)

    - Replaced the "accounts.xml" file with the user preferences ("prefs.xml").
        All non-host-specific project info is stored in this file;
        all host-specific project info is in client_state.xml.
        The PROJECT class is a union of the two.
        The logic for dealing with inconsistencies between
        prefs.xml and client_state.xml, and with updating in-memory
        and on-disk project lists in response to an update from a server,
        are a little tricky and are described in the code.
    - The prefs file can be overwritten by <preferences> in a scheduling
        server reply.  To prevent buggy servers from zeroing out
        users' project lists, the client makes sure there's at least
        one project, and backs up the old prefs.xml into a timestamped file.
    - The command-line client, if prefs.xml is absent,
        prompts the user for a project URL and authenticator,
        and creates an initial prefs.xml.
    - Each project now has a "master URL", with is its home page
        and also contains <scheduler> elements giving the URLs of
        its scheduling servers.
    - Added a class SCHEDULER_OP which encapsulates fetching and
        parsing a project's master page (if necessary),
        then making an RPC to one of its scheduling servers.
        TODO: add retry and failure logic.
    - A project can have more than one scheduling server.
        TODO: use all of them.
    - Project directories are stored in URL-encoded form.
        This allows project master URLs to have slashes, which is a necessity.

    - top-level Makefile now compiles RSAEuro/,
        and doesn't refer to sched_fcgi
    - Added <scheduler> element to html_user/index.html,
        making it the "master file" for test project.
        This file must be placed in the directory referred to by
        http://localhost/

David Anderson      July 4, 2002
    - Added support for upload authentication.
        This prevents bad guys from filling up data servers with trash.
        In this scheme, each <file_info> element sent from
        server to client includes a <max_nbytes> field limiting
        the size of the file, and includes a digital signature
        based on the project's "upload authentication" key pair.
        File uploads, instead of being done by PUT, are now done by POST
        to a CGI program, "file_upload_handler".
        The request header includes the signed <file_info>,
        and the CGI program verifies the signature and enforces the size limit.

        The affected pieces of code:
        - Added a function create_keys() in PHP test scripts
            to create encryption keys.  Call it from all script.
        - Added environment var BOINC_KEY_DIR saying where keys are kept.
        - The client must maintain an exact copy of each <file_info> XML,
            and of the signature, so that it can send to upload server.
        - Added a new variant of HTTP operation, HTTP_OP_POST2.
            The existing variants all use single files for request and reply.
            The new variant (used for file upload) has a request
            consisting of a memory block followed by (part of) a file;
            the reply is in memory.
            This avoid copying possibly huge upload files.
        - FILE_XFER objects now take a FILE_INFO as initialization argument;
            needed to convey authentication info.
            The upload variant creates and sends the authentication header.
        - Result templates now include a <max_nbytes> in each
            <file_info> element, and the URLs refer to the
            file_upload_handler (with no filename)
        - process_result_template() works differently, since it must
            generate a digital signature at the end of each <file_info>
        - create_work expects the name of a private key file.
        - Added crypt/md5 functions to sign/verify in memory,
            encode/decode ASCII data in memory, checksum in memory
    - Change "gmake" to "make" in top-level makefile.
        (alias make to gmake if this is a problem)

David A.    July 7, 2002
    - Added code signing.  All files associated with an app version
        (i.e. all executable files) must now be signed
        with the project's "code sign key".  The components include:
        - PROJECT has new field "code_sign_key", keep track of project's
            public code-signing key.
            Send this on each scheduler RPC.
        - The scheduling server stores the public code-signing key in memory.
            Send it to any client who doesn't have it.
            If the client has an old key,
            send them the new key signed with the old key.
            NOTE: this uses a scheme in which signatures are kept
            in files on the server, to avoid keeping private keys
            in online machines.  This should be documented.
        - The utility to add new app versions (add.C) adds a signature
            to the FILE_INFO element.
            NOTE: eventually the signing should be done offline.
        - FILE_INFO has a new boolean field "signature_required";
            set for all files associated with an app version
        - FILE_INFO has a new char* field "file_signature",
            which is the digital signature.
            Renamed upload authenticator from "signature" to "xml_signature"
            to avoid confusion.
        - Add function verify_downloaded_file(), called after every download;
            does MD5 or signature checking as needed.
        - Added some new functions for signature checking etc.
        - the client is now linked with the crypt library
    - Server-side errors should always include the name of the
        CGI program generating the error (scheduler or file upload handler)

David A     July 14 2002
    - Added reasonable policies for making scheduler RPCs.  Summary:
        - results now have a "report deadline".
            This may be useful for various purposes; for now,
            we use it to trigger scheduler RPCs to report results
        - The client now tries all a project's scheduler URLs in turn.
        - Projects have a "min_rpc_time", the earliest time to
            attempt another RPC (replaces next_request_time)
        - We maintain an RPC failure count for each project.
            If RPCs to all its URLs fail, we increment the count
            and set its min_rpc_time according to an exponential backoff
        - If a project is getting repeated RPC failures,
            reread and parse its master URL file every so often,
            in case the set of scheduler URLs has changed
        - When the client has a completed result past its deadline,
            it attempts to report it to that project.
        - When the client's estimated work falls below low water,
            it ranks projects according to their "resource deficit",
            then attempts RPCs to project in that order
            until the estimated work is above high water.
        NOTE: only the simplest case has been tested.
        We need to write test scripts for many other cases.
        NOTE: currently a result's report deadline is now+1000.
        We need to add a mechanism for setting it.
    - The CLIENT_STATE is now kept in a global variable instead of
        a local var of main().
        This is because SCHEDULER_OP needs to get at it.

    - Removed assembly optimized routines from RSAEuro, since we
      want to be platform independent and RSAEuro isn't a highly speed
      critical piece of code.  This had the side benefit of making the
      RSAEuro Makefile operate cleanly with make.
    - Fixed compiler warnings in RSAEuro demo programs.  Do we really
      need to keep these demo programs around?
    - Turned off the "secure" versions of memcpy, memset and memcmp.
      If needed, we can turn them back on.

David   July 28 2002
    - Changed the "add" utility so that, when adding an app version,
        you can give it the signature files (computed offline, presumably)
    - Changed the "add" utility so that an app version can consist
        of multiple files
    - Removed the notion of alpha/beta/production versions of an app.
        The same effect can be achieved by making separate projects
        for alpha and beta testing.
    - Apps now have a "minimum version number" on the server side -
        Don't send a WU unless there's an app version of that number or greater.
        Send the latest available version for the platform.
    - Clarified app version semantics:
        - Workunits don't have a version# on the server
        - When a client gets a workunit, it associates it with
            the most recent version of the application that it knows about
            (possibly one it received in the same reply message).
            It continues to use this version for this WU,
            even if it receives a later version while the WU is in progress.
        - On the client, no version #s are associated with apps

    PROGRAMMERS NOTE:
    - Removed checking of args in client_state.C
        This gunks up the code too much.  Let's do checking at higher level.
    - Comments should be in the imperative mood.
        "Write the state file", not "Writes the state file"
    - Comments should not be vague, e.g.
        // See if the application (name) associated with project p is
        // around here
        ... what does "around here" mean?
    - Leave a space between "if" and "("
    - When asserting that a pointer is non-NULL, just say "assert(p)".
        Saying "assert(p!=NULL)" is like saying if (flag==true)
    - Linux doesn't have -lsocket and -lnsl.
        Don't put them in Makefile.in.

    Various changes to API:
        - Added user, team names, credit info to APP_INIT_DATA
        - separate call for getting init data
        - separate call for returning fraction done
        - separated out fraction_done_update_period
        - moved graphics API to separate file
        - moved MFILE implementation to separate file
        - API timer is now 0.1 sec; use counters for various uses
            (checkpoint, fraction done, graphics)
        - changed name of API files to boinc_api.C,h

    - clarify distinction between
        "current CPU time"
        "CPU time at last checkpoint"
        "CPU time at start of current run"
        These are all kept in ACTIVE_TASK.
        RESULT now only has "final CPU time".

    - fixed bug in dir scanning (ahem...)

    - Coding style notes:
        - every fopen() MUST have a matching fclose() in same function
        - every malloc() MUST have a matching free() in same function
        - don't do a rewind() right after fopen()
        - write function calls as
            func(arg1, arg2);
            NOTE: there's a space after every comma, everywhere
        - write "if" statements as
            if (condition) {
                ...
            }
        - no explicit argument checking.  do this at higher level
        - functions in foo.C should be declared (as extern) in foo.h,
            AND NOWHERE ELSE.

          up after a period of time.  Giving up is currently

      flags and represents what phase of the computation pipeline
      each result is currently at (downloading, computing, uploading,
      etc).
    - Added file upload/download resumption.  For downloads, this
      involves checking how big the local file is, then asking
      the server for the remainder of it.  For uploads, this
      involves asking the file_upload_handler how much of a certain
      file it already has, then sending the remainder of it.
      Both ul and dl resumption need to be thoroughly tested.

        - Some places require \ instead of / in paths.
          Added the constant PATH_SEPARATOR for this purpose.

    - return user name, total credit, avg credit in scheduler RPC reply
        - save/restore these in client state file
    - client was trying to delete "checkpoint CPU file" in wrong directory
    - change CLIENT_STATE field from "version" to "core_client_version"
    - got rid of CLIENT_STATE::update_net_stats(), insert_file_xfer()
        (made some stuff public)
    - disable host performance measurement (temp! turn back on later)
    - removed comments of the form
        read_config_file();    // read config file
    - in HTTP op of type POST2, it's not an error if htp->file is zero
    - replaced hardwired HTTP_STATUS constants

    - in test/init.inc, don't use the init_db() from html_user/.
        define it separately here.

    - added DB fields to keep track of credit for hosts and result
    - added utility program "grant_credit" to grant credit for a result
    - removed some extraneous printfs
    - file upload handler error messages have user name
    - added a "poll_debug" flag; turn this on in case of infinite
        poll loop, to see what's causing the problem
    - added a "libboinc.a" target to lib/ Makefile.
        We might want to consider using a random library
        instead of referring to explicit .o files everywhere

    - Move account into (master URL, authenticator, per-project prefs)
        from the prefs.xml file into separate files, one per project
        (with names of the form account_XXX.xml, XXX = master URL).
        Adding new projects is now done using the core client
        (via GUI or command line) or by copying an existing account file,
        but NOT via web site; this was a major security weakness
        since bad guys could guess your web password,
        then register you for a bogus project.

        This change also involved the html_user files (not finished).

    - Further work on credit-granting.
        On each RPC, the scheduler computes a "credit per CPU second"
        for the host (linear combo of FP/int/mem speeds).
        For each result received, the scheduler computes a "claimed credit",
        the claimed CPU time times the credit per CPU second.
        It also sets the "need validate" flag of the WU.

        are stored in the database and in the core client,
        and the protocol (part of scheduler RPC) for maintaining them.

    - Changed the PHP framework for testing to facilitate
        multi-project, multi-host tests (all on one machine).
        See doc/test.html for details.
    - NOTE: the BOINC-related environment variables have changed.
        There are no longer any project-specific variables
        (e.g. database name, shmem key)
    - NOTE: the server programs now expect a configuration file
        in their directory.
    - TODO: enhance the testing framework to allow projects with
        multiple scheduling servers or data servers
    - TODO: enhance the testing framework to allow specification
        of failure and recovery of servers

    - changed things so a NULL in the DB won't crash db_mysql.C
    - parse_int() can now handle hex
    - "add" now takes args for DB name/passwd

    - updated test scripts to use new framework
    - got rid of some obsolete scripts

David   Oct 8 2002
    - progress getting "make_work" (dummy work generator) to work.
        Removed the <name> element from workunit XML,
        and the <name> and <wu_name> elements from result XML;
        instead, the scheduler server inserts these as it sends them.

        This simplifies things a little in work generation,
        and removes some redundancy.

        Everything seems to work now except that the file upload signature
        ends up being wrong, which is expected,
        and it shows that the security mechanism works.
    - added test_loop.php, which simulates a system that is complete
        except for the validation process.

    - Change make_work so that it generates results with
        valid file upload signatures.
        Instead of directly creating new DB.result records,
        it now calls create_result() to do the work.
    - Changed create_result() to take a name suffix
    - Factored key parsing into a function
    - Removed random-WU-name feature from create_work;
        names should be generated at a higher level
    - added a key-generation function to test.inc

        (remove some DB fields and code relating to it)
    - remove the nresults_* fields from the workunit table.
        These are redundant, and they weren't being used.
        Furthermore, they were being updated in a way that
        overwrote other updates.

    - floating-point values are passed to/from MySQL using sprintf and atof.
        The "%f" format, by default, uses 6 decimal places of precision.
        This is inadequate for small values, e.g. 1e-7.
        So db_mysql.C should use %.12e instead of %f.

    - fixed bug that caused file upload authentication failure
    - The user web site now correctly provides download of the core client,
        as long as you add a core client app version in your test script
        (see test_uc.php for an example)
    - version numbers now come from env vars BOINC_MAJOR_VERSION
        and BOINC_MINOR_VERSION.  You must set these in your .cshrc
    - Web server config file must have
        DefaultType application/octet-stream
        so that core client is saved as file, not displayed
    - replaced "db_name" file in html_user, html_ops directories with

    - If request to scheduling server is from client with wrong version,
        return an error
    - Change the file upload handler protocol a little:
        1) add core client version to request
        2) add enclosing <data_server_request> element
    - The file upload handler returns an error if client has wrong version
    - Split up long function in file_upload_handler.C
    - Changed name of feeder trigger file so that it works

    - change scheduling server so that by default it doesn't
        store request and reply messages in files;
        add "-use_files" option to do this
    - added validation step to test_uc.php;
        this computes and grants credit
    - added "-one_pass" option to validate
    - split scheduler trigger files into two:
        stop_server: used for all server components;
            NOT deleted after reading
        reread_db: used to tell feeder to reread DB
            deleted after reading

David   Dec 5 2002
    - added initial support for aborting runaway applications:
        check for exceeding maximum CPU time or disk usage
    - create_work now takes max_cobblestones and max_disk_usage
    - split ACTIVE_TASK::suspend into separate suspend, resume functions

    A bunch of coding style notes:
    - changed ACTIVE_TASK::request_exit() so that it doesn't sleep.
        ==> The core client should never sleep <==
        This would cause a period of non-response in the GUI client
    - changed file_delete() so that it doesn't sleep or retry.
        Should eventually add garbage-collection mechanism
    - Most functions NEED to be implemented in the client.
        So e.g. instead of
        #if HAVE_SIGNAL_H
            unix code
        #endif
        #ifdef _WIN32
            win code
        #endif
        we should have
        #ifdef _WIN32
            win code
        #else
            unix code
        #endif
        Any compilation that doesn't match anything should cause a
        compile-time error
    - change file_size(), dir_size(), CLIENT_STATE::total_disk_usage() etc.
        so that:
        1) they report file size in double, not int
        2) they return an error code, not a size overloaded with error code;
            size is return in reference param
    - All fopen()s should check for zero pointer and return ERR_FOPEN
    - Omit "this->" wherever it appears

    - added field client_state to result

    - added some more functionality to repor_project_error()
      It now adds the following info to stderr_out of the result:

      <message>message if any passed</mesage>
      <active_task_state>%d</active_task_state>
      <exit_status>%d</exit_status>
      <signal>%d</signal>
      if download had failures
         "<download_error>\
          "    <file_name>%s</file_name>
          "    <error_code>%d</error_code>\n"
          "    </download_error>\n"


      if upload  had failures
        same as above

      if coudln't start active task for result (in which err_num should be set)
        "<couldnt_start>%d</couldnt_start>\n"


    - The error mechanism right now is such that any failures
    regarding file_infos (download, upload or whatever)
    are recorded in the status of the file_infos and then garbage collect
    called report_project_error.
    However errors regarding starting and ending active tasks
    are reported from app.C and cs_apps.C.

    - Have process_wu_template() fill in the file size as well as the MD5.
        This necessitated changing the format of WU templates,

        it's input files are copied along with it,
        with some random numbers added to the end,
        so for each new work_unit there are a set of associated new input files

    -fixed a little bug in file_deleter

    -note: strtok() changes the original string passed to it, kind of dangerous to use

    -from parse.h : replace_element() is now in use ( I used it for make_work.C)

    NOTE: there must be an index for each field or combination of fields
        that we do a "select" on!!

David  Jan 6 2003
    - change all server programs to do logging the same way:
        - all log entries written to stderr
        - write date/time at start of log entries
        - don't include program or user name in log entries
    - client: when get no work from project,
        don't back off if we're in exit_when_idle mode
    - added ob_end_flush() call in test.inc so that PHP test scripts
        have unbuffered output
    - added other backend phases (validate, file_delete) to test_loop.php
    - PROGRAMMER NOTES:
        - don't use tab chars in files
        - split long comments into separate lines
        - "extern" should never appear in a .C file
        - Don't use member function names that conflict with global functions
            (e.g. CLIENT_STATE::exit(); use cleanup_and_exit() instead)

        May need to get working on Solaris
    - Added stripchart scripts for getting DB info

    - Split off dummy assimilation function from the main program.
    - Added new stripchart scripts for logging DB counts
        and directory sizes

    NOTE: it looks like shared memory segment is at same address
    in feeder and cgi.  So it's OK to use pointers in it.

        All programs now use lock files to prevent duplicate execution.
        A new program "start_servers" reads config.xml and starts servers.
    - Added "user-friendly name" field to platform, so that users
        see e.g. "Windows 95/98/XP" instead of "windows_intelx86"

    - added "opaque" fields to result and workunit tables.
        (allows projects to cross-reference to their science DB)
    - added "venue" field to host (home/school/work)
        This has two goals:
        1) provides a basis for multiple preference sets
            (one each for home/school/work)
        2) provides another account breakdown for stats
    - added "venue" field to user
        This is the default venue, for newly created hosts
    - simplified preferences:
        For account setup, all preferences are now on one form
        (different forms for new/return users)
        For preference editing, preferences are now in two groups
            - project preferences, including resource share,
                venue, and per-project prefs
            - global prefs (called "BOINC prefs" in user interface)
    - fixed bug where user/host credits in client state file were giant numbers

David  Feb 19 2003
    - Added scheme for verified user update of email address
        When user updates email address, their email address in the DB
        is set to a "munged" form that includes a random string,
        and an email is sent to the new address that includes a
        URL that they must visit to verify the change.
    - The same mechanism is used on account creation;
        the email DB field is initially set to a munged form.
        This prevents hackers from adding entries to the DB
        with other peoples' email addresses.
    - Separate logic for update email address from update other user info;
        remove combinatorial logic (?) for update other user info

    - changed windows graphics handling.

        it to draw on the window.

    - Implemented network throughput limits, part of global prefs.
        There are separate limits for upload and download.
        Implementation: the NET_XFER_SET objects now has fields for
        1) the max # bytes/sec up and down (from global prefs)
        2) the limit on bytes that can be xferred this second
            Can go negative.  If it's negative, don't include
            sockets in select().
            Replenish every second.
        This replaces an implementation that didn't work
    - Reimplemented the way network throughput is measured.
        The old way measured throughput for each file xfer, and kept an average.
        This doesn't work with multiple simultaneous xfers.
        The new way uses a NET_STATS::poll() function.
        If there has been an active file xfer during the last poll period
        (new logic in NET_XFER_SET lets you find this out)
        then you add the duration of the polling period,
        and the number of bytes transferred.
        The reported throughput is averaged with throughput
        from previous sessions of the core client.
    - Increased file xfer blocksize from 4KB to 16KB
    - Got rid of dynamic buffer allocation in NET_XFER
    - Renamed "water days" to "work buf days" everywhere
    NOTE:
        clock() measure calling process CPU time, not time of day.
        Use time(0) if you want time of day.

    - added PHP code for creating/editing/deleting multiple pref sets
        See "prefs.inc" for a description of the XML format.
        Prefs are divided into two subsets (global and project).
        For each subset there is a mandatory "primary" version
        and optional versions for home, school, and work.
        The prefs display/editing code has been consolidated
        and parameterized (subset = global or project,
        venue = none, home, school, work).
        This actually simplifies things a little.

    - use venue-specific prefs on client side:
        - schedule server passes <host_venue> element in scheduler reply
            (but only when it passes back new global prefs)
        - when parsing global prefs, if find a matching
            <venue> element, parse its contents and ignore all else
        - when passing project-specific prefs to app,
            look for matching <venue> element
    - changed XML syntax of venue-specific prefs: instead of
        <home>...</home>, e.g., use
        <venue name="home">...</venue>
    - added safe_strncpy(): always adds zero byte at end.
        Use this instead of strncpy().

    - new show_message() conventions (not fully implemented):
        - all error conditions should call show_message() with MSG_ERROR
        - all log writes should use show_message() with MSG_INFO
        TODO: change Win implementation of show_message() to
        write to window AND to file (stderr.txt or stdout.txt)
    - messages are now timestamped and show project name
    - use start_table() and row2() more uniformly in user HTML
    - user HTML: show message if can't connect to DB
    - standardize terminology in user HTML: "general prefs",
        "default computer location", etc.

      into sched_util.C
    - Added stop_server checking to more server programs
    - Added update_stats program to periodically update exponential average
      credit for users and hosts, and to update team credit by summing member credit
    - Added db_sum, db_query_double to retrieve sums of columns (used by update_stats)
    - Added db_user_sum_team_expavg_credit, db_user_sum_team_total_credit,

        - changed windows graphics handling again.  client/app messaging
                now mainly consists of the client polling the app windows,
                with apps messaging the client when they change modes.
                moved most of this into the client's child screensaver window.

    - changed client exit to send a quit request to the apps, wait 1
      second for them to quit, then kill them if they're still open.
      This allows applications to do a final checkpoint before
      quitting, rather than lose their recent work

    - Changed app->client communication to use shared memory rather
      than files.  The client sets up a shared memory segment when
      starting the app. The app attaches to it and writes XML tags
      into a 4K text buffer every second.
    - The shared memory communication has been tested by hand under
      Windows and UNIX (Mac OS X).  We should write test scripts for
      it to make sure.

    - Changed all occurrences of "time test" and "speed test"

Erik  May 6 2003
    - Added a notion of "transient" and "permanent" errors on file uploads.
        A permanent error is returned by the file upload handler if
            - the request is malformed
            - filename includes ".."
            - the signature is bad
            - the file size is larger than allowed
        PERS_FILE_XFER checks for this return from FILE_XFER
        and gives up immediately.
    - FILE_XFER now always parses the server response (not just for file size)
    - Added some missing error checks to FILE_XFER
    - Punted on the timezone-related ifdefs:
        added hardwired ifdefs for linux and unix.
        Need to revisit this
    - in PHP test library, add a provision for multiple files per application

    - Added a new class SS_LOGIC that encapsulates the core client's
        screensaver-related logic.
        It tries to get graphics-capable apps to provide graphics,
        and if necessary it draws logo-based graphics or blanks the screen.
    - Changed ACTIVE_TASK.app_client_shm from a pointer to an object.

Erik  May 13 2003
    - Added a notion of "tentative" project.
        This means that the (URL, account ID) pair hasn't been verified,
        i.e. we haven't fetched the master page, found a scheduler,
        and done a scheduler op that verified the account ID.
        If anything fails for a tentative project, call project_add_failed().
        in the cmdline version this prints an error message,
        deletes all evidence of the project, and exits.
        TODO: implement for GUI
    - Make write_account_file() into a member function of PROJECT.
    - Got rid of CLIENT_STATE::change_project().
        The user must detach and attach.
    - CLIENT_STATE::quit_project() now takes a PROJECT*, not an int.
        Need to change the GUI code.
    - got rid of separate WIN_32 implementations of
        make_project_dir(), remove_project_dir(), make_slot_dir().
        THIS IS THE WRONG LEVEL FOR PLATFORM-DEPENDENT CODE!
        Instead, added boinc_mkdir() and boinc_rmdir()
    - added implementation docs for screensaver logic
    - test_uc.php: wait for a second before running client.
        On fast computers the client runs before feeder has seeded shmem.

Erik  May 16 2003
    - set FILE_INFO::upload_offset to -1 before restarting file upload.
        This forces file size check, so that upload can resume
        with nonzero offset.
        NOTE: THE USE OF "SPECIAL VALUES" (LIKE -1) IS DISCOURAGED
    - don't set RESULT::state to NEW after parse.
        This caused completed results to start over.
    - PERS_FILE_XFER::start_xfer() is int, not bool
    - better messages on file transfer failure and project backoff
    - better message from scheduler if wrong major version
    - file upload handler logging is on by default

Erik  May 19 2003
    - added support for user-selected files to be included
        as part of an app_version.
        If there is an element of the form
            <app_file>
                <url>X</url>
                <open_name>Y</open_name>
            </app_file>
        in a user's project preferences,
        then for every APP_VERSION that is sent to the user,
        elements of the form
            <file_info>
                <name>X'</name>
                <url>X</url>
            </file_info>
            ... and in the <app_version> element
            <file_ref>
                <file_name>X'</file_name>
                <open_name>Y</open_name>
            </file_ref>
        are added to the app version's XML description,
        where X' is an escaped version of X.
        This can be used (for example) to allow applications to
        have user-specified images in their graphics
    - Handle it correctly if the "insert" part of a file transfer fails
    - The "main program" of an app version is the one labeled <main_program/>
        (not necessarily the first one)
    - Only files labeled <executable/> are required to be signed
    - added copyright notice to some files
    - added sgets() for parsing a string that is made up of multiple lines
    - write MD5 checksum elements only if checksum is present
    - created escape_url_readable

    TODO: app_versions are currently treated as immutable by client.
        Need to change this.

    - various changes to support abort of apps if use too much disk or CPU
        - send workunit rsc_* fields in scheduler reply; store on client
        - scheduler doesn't send estimated CPU time; instead,
            client calculates it

    - abort applications that exceed max disk usage
        Do this check at most global_prefs.disk_interval seconds
    - moved code that detaches core/app shared memory from
        CLIENT_STATE::handle_finished_apps() to
        ACTIVE_TASK::check_app_exited()
        NOTE: ACTIVE_TASK IS SUPPOSED TO ENCAPSULATE TASK IMPLEMENTATION
    - CLIENT_STATE::handle_finished_apps(): don't view an app as finished
        if it's in PROCESS_ABORT_PENDING state
    - got rid of ACTIVE_TASK_SET::poll_time();
        moved its functionality to ACTIVE_TASK_SET::poll()
    - broke up ACTIVE_TASK_SET::poll() into subfunctions:
        get_cpu_times(), check_app_exited(),
        check_max_cpu_exceeded(), check_max_disk_exceeded()
    - change function names:
        get_cpu_time() -> get_cpu_time_via_os()
        check_app_state() -> get_cpu_time_via_shmem()
        handle_running_aps() -> handle_finished_apps()

        Canonicalize master urls to have a trailing '/' and remove double
        slashes.  Ensure account filenames and directories do not have the
        trailing '_'.  For many users their account files already have
        trailing '_'s so if such files are found, rename them and their
        corresponding project directories on startup.  Created C++ string
        versions of some functions for easier/safer/more efficient string

    - Astropulse: if output file doesn't exist yet when opening, write a
      version number.
    - scheduler: renamed config.h to sched_config.h to avoid conflict with
      default autoconf config.h
    - api: added MFILE::ftell() function

    - revised backend logic

    - changed "timeout_check" to "transitioner"

David  Aug 15 2003
    - changed logic so that create_work doesn't create any results;
        this is left to the transitioner, since it does this anyway.
        This required adding a result_template field to the workunit table,
        which is the original result template macro-substituted
        with the upload URL

    - rewrote header parsing to be more robust:
        - allow for header to not have to be a single TCP message
        - parse line-by-line instead of full-header strstr for efficiency
        - compare header names case insensitively

    - Client: project reset wasn't working in cmdline version
        if there was an active task
        (because kill_task() blindly sends a KILL signal,
        even though no process has been started yet so the PID is zero,

       There are now separate estimates and bounds for FP ops.
       Nothing about integer ops.
       Disk and memory numbers are bounds.

       This changes the client/server RPC format and the DB format,

    - start and add.py know where config.xml and run_state.xml are
      (customizable too)

    - finished database.py and add.py

    - fix bug in scheduler: the buffer in insert_wu_tags() wasn't large enough.
        This is a powerful argument in favor of using "string" everywhere!
    NOTE: in spite of fix, test_uc.py isn't working.  Problem w/ proxy?
    - HTTP_OP_SET::poll(): if header read_reply() returns nonzero,
        set htp->io_ready to false (to avoid lots and lots of spurious recv()s)
    - in test scripts: if TEST_STOP_BEFORE_RUN is set,
        go into sleep loop rather than exiting
        (to avoid deleting the test setup)

        to use different MySQL databases at the same time.
        A new class DB_CONN represents a connection to a database.
        Old functions like boinc_db_open() etc. are members of this class.
        The connection to the BOINC database is represented by
        by a global object "boinc_db" of this class.
        You're free to have others
        (e.g. "app_db" in the work gen or assimilator for an app)

    - working on python code:
        - database back end:
            - database objects are now weakly hashed, with a cached list of
              size 1024.
            - new count() methods with arbitrary arguments like find()
        - misc. bug fixes

        - make_project and setup_project modify database directly instead of
          calling old_add

        - make_project doesn't add platform, app, or app_version

Karl 2003/09/07
    - changed all user-visible cobblestone numbers to use a new
      format_credit() function which does sprintf %.3f

    - allow sorting top_{team,user,host}s.php by either expavg_credit or
      total_credit (default expavg_credit)

    html_user/*.php, *.inc

    - changed "Results uploaded" to "Outputs uploaded"

      result = results[I]"

    Sched/
        transitioner.C

David  Sept 11 2003
    - transitioner: set file delete state to READY only if it's currently INIT
        This should make file_deleter more efficient,
        because each WU/result is file-deleted only once.
        Also means that unlink()s should always succeed
    - file deleter: print retval of unlink() (should always be zero)

    sched/
        file_deleter.C
        transitioner.C

Karl 2003/09/15
    - fixed transitioner bug where usage of `unsigned int' instead of signed
      int caused 400k results to be generated.

    Sched/
        transitioner.C

Eric K. 16-Sep-2003
    - added "const" qualifiers to prototype for create_work and some others
      where appropriate.  I didn't fix all the API routines where parameters
      should be const.  Using C++ makes it important to get these right.

    No code changes.  This is the branch point for the seti beta.  The tag is:

        setiathome-4.xx_all_platforms_beta

    for both seti_boinc and boinc.  They both make on solaris without serious
    error and the resulting seti client links without error with the resulting
    boinc libs.

        create_work.C

David  Sept 21 2003
    - Added mechanism for marking results as COULDNT_SEND:
        When the scheduler finds that a result is infeasible
        for a host, it increments the "infeasible_count" in the work array.
        When the feeder finds that too many results in the array
        have nonzero infeasible_count, it marks some of them
        as COULDNT_SEND and removes them from the array

        boinc_db.h
    sched/
        feeder.C
        handle_request.C
        sched_shmem.h

David  Sept 21 2003
    - Partly debugged the above changes:
    - The feeder's result enumeration should have no limit;
        otherwise it may enumerate the same results over and over
    - If the infeasible_count of a result a threshold (MAX_INFEASIBLE_COUNT)
        the feeder marks it as couldnt_send.
        This prevents a situation where results sit in the work array
        forever, their infeasible_count approaching infinity
    - Added show_shmem to sched/ Makefile, and fleshed it out a bit
    - Show hostID correctly when get RPC from wrong major version

    NOTE: still haven't exercised the case where a result is marked COULDNT_SEND

    Modified DB_CONN::open() to support "db_name@host" syntax for remote
    database connections.

David  Sept 23 2003
    - Don't reference-count WUs for results that are ready to report
        (since don't need their input files anymore)
        NOTE: this means that RESULT.wup may be zero.
        Much check before dereferencing.
    - Changed "ready_to_ack" to "ready_to_report"
        (Ack is server->client, not client->server)
    - Changed "server_ack" to "got_server_ack"
    - Moved CLIENT_STATE integrity-check code to a new file (check_state.C)
        In general it would be nice to move stuff out of client_state.C;

    - Create an XML entity encoder/decoder for single byte entities.  In new
      files lib/xml_util.[Ch].  Encoder will make the following translations.
        '>' => "&gt;"
        '<' => "&lt;"
        '&' => "&amp;"
        "'" => "&apos;"
        '"' => "&quot;"
        other unprintable -> "&#nnnd;"
      The decoder recognizes a larger number of translations for single byte
      entities found in XML/HTML.

        and can assume that result->wup is always valid.
        I can't remember why we did this, but it creates too many problems.
    - in Windows GUI, if a result had an error in download or upload,
        display status as "Download failed" instead of "Download" etc.

     - redid graphics_api.h entirely.  C'mon people we use automake for a
       reason. Use the macros in config.h!

        1) max frames per second
        2) upper bound on rendering CPU time as a fraction or real time
        NOTE: currently these limits are hardware in the code.

    - rewrote make_project and related; a lot of restructuring:

        - make_project only creates the project and database but doesn't add
          platform, app, app_version, or core_version.  Use `add' for these.
        - database actions are through MySQLdb, removing need for mysql client
          binary.

        it shrinks the image in one dimension or the other, and centers
        it in the allotted space
    - Add a GRAPH_DRAW_STYLE field to REDUCED_ARRAY

    - Don't send two results from the same WU in a single RPC
        Note: this is a weak but possibly sufficient step towards not sending
        multiple results from the same WU to one user.
    - Scheduler: before updating a result, reread it from the database.
        What's in shared memory may be way out of date.

    - Added debugging printfs (enabled by #define DEBUG)
        to wingui_mainwindow.cpp.  These write to C:/temp/core.txt.
    - In CMyApp::InitInstance(), changed 2nd arg of CreateMutex
        from false to true.  This matches "1 instance" code samples from web.
        Thought it might fix startup bug - no.
    - Added debugging printfs (enabled by #define DEBUG) into screensaver;
        causes it to write info to C:/temp/boinc_scr.txt
    - Removed CREATE_NO_WINDOW and IDLE_PRIORITY flags from
        CreateProcess() call in screensaver.
        These aren't listed in the MSDN man page; are they needed?
    - slight change to startup logic in screensaver:
        - send it a BOINC_SS_START message only if it's already running
            (not needed if start it ourselves, since we give it -saver arg)
        - don't wait for 3 seconds after starting it
    - In the cmdline passed to the core client from screensaver,
        make argv[0] the real path of the executable.
        Thought this might fix startup bug - no.
    - Change "start_saver" to "started_by_screensaver".  Truth in advertising.

        which is needed to decide which project prefs to use,
        is kept in the client state file.
        So I added a new function, parse_venue(), that gets the
        host venue from the state file; this is done before parsing account files.
    - Also added <project_name> element to account file so that we can
        display that correctly in message about project prefs

        - Added a new message type <reread_prefs/> to the
            core->app graphics segment
        - When the graphics framework (windows_opengl.C) gets this message,
            it calls an application function app_graphics_reread_prefs().
            This function can call boinc_parse_init_data_file() (see below)
            to get the new prefs
    - Core client: when get new project preferences,
        write new init_data.xml files for all running apps,
        and send them <reread_prefs/> messages.

    - Changed the way that user-supplied files (e.g. logos and images) work.
        OLD WAY: (see checkin by "Erik", May 19 2003)
            the scheduling server scans the user's project prefs
            and inserts <file_info> and <file_ref> elements
            into the <app_version> element,
            making it look like the user-supplied files are associated
            with the app.
            This necessitated the slightly kludgy "optional"
            attribute of FILE_INFO, so that slow-downloading
            user-supplied files wouldn't defer work indefinitely.
        NEW WAY:
            The scheduling server is not involved.
            PROJECT now has list "user_files" of FILE_REFS
            FILE_INFO now has an attribute "is_user"file"
            - When parse project prefs from account file,
                or when get new project preferences from server,
                convert <app_file> elements to entries in project.user_files
            - new function ACTIVE_TASK::link_user_files() makes links
                from slot dir to all user files that are present
            - when the download of a user file completes,
                tell running apps to reread prefs
                (they'll find the user file now)
            - garbage collection reference-counts user files
            - got rid of "optional" mechanism
        With this change, user-supplied images in graphics are updated
        dynamically when the user edits prefs on web,
        then does "Get Preferences" in core client
    - Handling of completed file transfers moved from
        PERS_FILE_XFER::poll() to CLIENT_STATE::handle_pers_file_xfers().
        (this job of PERS_FILE_XFER is to transfer the file,
        not deal with its contents)
    - changed benchmarks defaults from 1GFLOPs to 10MFLOPs;
        prevents slow computers from being inundated with work

David  4 Nov 2003
    - scheduler now respects disk usage limits.
        Scheduler request message now includes BOINC disk usage,
        both total and for this project.
        The scheduler parses user's global preferences
        to get disk-related prefs,
        and computes the max storage that can be used.
        It will send only as many results as fit within this limit.
        NOTE: this is still deficient in several ways:
            - it assumes that all results will use all their storage
                simultaneously.  It doesn't take into account that
                some results may use large storage while running,
                but not before or after.
            - it doesn't take into account storage that has been
                committed (to this or other projects) but not yet in use.
            - there's no mechanism for enforcing resource shares for storage,
                or for dynamic adjustment
    - print exit codes in both dec and hex

    - The following changes fix core client crashes that occur when
        reset a project, then quickly detach from the project
        while downloads are occurring.
        In once instance, this produced a state file that caused
        the client to crash each time it started up.
    - when parse an ACTIVE_TASK in state file,
        verify that the corresponding result is in the right state
        (RESULT_FILES_DOWNLOADED, with got_server_ack and ready_to_report false)
    - when parse a RESULT in state file,
        make sure it's consistent: in particular,
        if got_server_ack or ready_to_report is true,
        the state must be RESULT_FILES_UPLOADED

David  6 Nov 2003
    - cleaned up CPU time chaos
        OLD:
            An app measures and reports its CPU time when it calls
            boinc_time_to_checkpoint(), which may be infrequent.
            The reported CPU time is for the whole process
            (including graphics thread: wrong)
            If the core client doesn't get a message within 5 seconds,
            it measures app CPU time externally,
            with ACTIVE_TASK::get_cpu_time_via_os()
            (this can cause reported CPU time to jump up and down).
            Ambiguous function boinc_cpu_time(): does it return time for
            calling thread only?  time since WU start?
        NEW:
            An app measures and reports its CPU time every 1 sec,
            from the timer interrupt.
            The reported CPU time is only for the worker thread.
            Replace boinc_cpu_time() with:
                boinc_thread_cpu_time(): CPU time of calling thread
                    (also used by graphics_cpi.C to measure rendering time)
                boinc_wu_cpu_time(): CPU time of WU so far (for graphics thread)
            Notes:
            - The app no longer needs to call boinc_time_to_checkpoint()
                with any regularity
            - the timer interrupt handler runs on a different thread,
                so we record the worker thread handle.
    - use double rather than time_t in calculation of estimated completion
    - Code cleanup:
        removed some declarations from boinc_api.h
            (Don't declare internal functions in a .h file!)
        removed using_opengl, write_frac_done
        made things static that should be static

            - host is too slow
        This involved creating a WORK_REQ structure that gets passed
        around, to avoid huge numbers of arguments
    - modify the scheduler so that if either
        1) the shared-mem segment is absent or
        2) the DB can't be opened
        then it writes a "project temporarily down for maintenance"
        message instead of just exiting

    - Changes to a running app's checkpoint_cpu_time
        (as conveyed in shared-memory msgs)
        were not triggering state file writes.
        As a result the CPU time of a result was, in general,
        returning to zero after a reboot.
    - ACTIVE_TASK_SET::poll(): if any task's checkpoint_cpu_time has changed,
        trigger a client state file write
    - renamed ACTIVE_TASK_SET::get_cpu_times() -> get_status_msgs()
        Also, this function now returns boolean:
        whether any checkpoint_cpu_time has changed
    - renamed ACTIVE_TASK::get_cpu_time_via_shmem() -> get_status_msg()
        (since the message includes more than just CPU time)
    - removed ACTIVE_TASK.last_status_msg_time (not used)
    - factored out logic to compute frac_rate_of_change
        and put it in a separate function

            if (!found) continue;

        PROJECT now has separate fields for

            project_specific_prefs (only project specific,
                and only for current venue).
        These had been confused before.
        The account_*.xml file has the project_prefs,
        enclosed in a <project_preferences> element
    - updated document about account files
    - Changed project prefs from char[MAX_BLOB_LEN] to string,
        and added variant of copy_element_contents() for string.

    - Extend the "start" script to handle remote tasks.  Summary:
        - config.xml has a mandatory config.host element
            (for the project's main server)
            and optional task.host elements (default is main host)
        - Host X has its own run state file, run_state_X.xml
        - Host X has its own pid directory, pid_dir_X/
        - Host X has its own log directory, log_X/
        - Host X has its own lock file for "start", start.lock.X
        - run_daemons() etc. run tasks only for the current host
        - When run on the main host, start builds a list of other hosts
            and runs itself (with same cmdline, using ssh)
            on each of the other hosts.

        Notes:
        1) I didn't add <host>*</host> capability;
            it's not clear that we need this
        2) Output formatting could be improved

    - Fixed bugs involving buffer overflow of BLOB fields.
        These can be up to 65536 bytes in MySQL.
        MAX_BLOB_SIZE was defined as 4K.
        strcpy2() didn't do any buffer size checking.
        A team description was over 8K long.
        This caused db_dump to crash.
        Solution:
        - strcpy2() now defined as a macro that uses the sizeof()
            its destination, and doesn't overwrite it.
        - MAX_BLOB_SIZE replaced with 2 symbols:
            MEDIUM_BLOB_SIZE for fields used by BOINC
                defined as 4K so as to not increase shmem usage
            LARGE_BLOB_SIZE for fields with user-supplied text
                defined as 64K

    - We have the same gcc version problem with solaris that we do with
      linux whereby if the  version number of libstdc++.so on the run
      machine is different than that on the build machine, the loader
      fails.  However, on solaris you cannot just say gcc -static as there
      are dynamic only versions of some needed libs, namely libdl and
      libaio.  I tried to use the -Xlinker gcc option which theoretically
      should allow us to specify the link (collect2) line in precise
      detail.  But -lstdc++ kept showing up twice with one occurrence
      being outside my -Xlinker -B -Xlinker static directive.  So I
      hand crafted a collect2 line and placed it in a file - collect2_line.
      Sourcing this file produces an executable that will load and run
      across gcc versions (and solaris versions for that matter).  I
      don't like it but it works.

      IMPORTANT NOTE.  After sourcing collect2_line you have to
      re-"hard link" the executable boinc_client to a proper
      name with the correct version.

    - Add <db_host> element to config file and SCHED_CONFIG.
        Add db_host argument to DB_CONN::open()
        All server programs can now be run on different machine from MySQL
    - Add "deprecated" field to app table
        Deprecated apps are treated as non-existent
    - Add "deprecated", "user_friendly_name" to platform table
        Deprecated platforms are treated as non-existent
    - Add new value for validate_state: VALIDATE_STATE_NO_CHECK
        This indicates the the result's WU had an error,
        and the result will never be validated.
        Such results are not counted towards pending credit.
        Transitioner: when set a WU error flag,
            change its results VALIDATE_STATE_INIT -> NO_CHECK
    - Add "Applications" page to web site:

    - changed the way tab windows are hidden/shown in windows gui,
      to fix intermittent window repainting bug.
        old:
           <hide all windows by setting turning off WS_VISIBLE style>
           <show selected window by turning on WS_VISIBLE style>
           <redraw window>
           The trouble with this technique is that it does not
           activate the window, so it will only work if the
           window becomes active *before* the redraw takes place.
        new:
           <hide all visible windows via ShowWindow(SW_HIDE)>
           <redraw selected window >
           <show selected window via ShowWindow(SW_SHOW)>

    - add result.exit_status field to DB
        Currently this is populated by the server,
        if there's a <exit_status> element in the reply's stderr_out.

    - added boinc_fopen() function.
       This should be used in lieu of fopen(), in both core client and apps,
       whenever opening a file for writing.
       This is because on Windows a utility program like FileFind
       might have the file open at that exact moment,
       and your fopen() will fail.
       boinc_fopen() deals with this by sleeping for 3 seconds and trying again.
       NOTE: in SETI@home there's a much fancier function
       that does exponential backoff up to one hour.
       Can't do that here, in part because the GUI requires
       the core client to be nonblocking.

    - Fixed errors in deciding whether more work was needed,
        and if so how much.
        This caused a situation where hosts would repeatedly
        ask the server for more work
        (which, because of recent anti-spam mechanism, would return no work)
        The error involved the confusion of two quantities:
        1) work buffer
            This is an estimate of the time (measured in days)
            until this host will finish all current work.
            It reflects the host's "active_frac" and the # of CPUs.
        2) CPU time
            This is an estimate of the CPU time a WU will take on this host.
            It does not reflect active_frac or # of CPUs
        Example error: current_work_buf_days() didn't reflect active_frac and ncpus.
        So we underestimated the work buffer, and requested work inappropriately.

        NOTE: the <work_req_seconds> field in a request message
        is in units of CPU time, NOT work buffer

    - Fixed errors in estimating the wallclock duration of a WU
        (used in feasibility test in scheduler):
        Should divide, not multiply, by active_frac;
        should not multiply by # cpus
    - add a "deprecated" flag to app_version.
        If you decide that a particulate app_version has problems,
        you can deprecate it.
        The scheduler advertises the latest non-deprecated version.
        NOTE: this only is effective if core clients have the following:
    - Changed the policy assigning an app_version to a WU
        Use the version included in the scheduler reply,
        and if there is none, use the latest version.
        This means that if a project deprecates an app_version,
        clients won't use it.

    - don't show #results in 1-line host summary (too slow)
    - totally redid "host merge" mechanism.
        - show all hosts that are compatible with this one
            (not just older ones)
        - show checkboxes with "select all" button
            so you can easily merge large #s of hosts
        - merge logic merges into newest host
    - let anyone look at any result and any host
        (may want to change this later,
        but for now it helps with debuggin)
    - write log message when scheduler creates new host
        because of bad RPC seqno

    - more trickle support:
        - server parses <trickle> elements from RPC request,
            creates trickle records,
            sends <trickle_ack> if it did any
        - client scans project for trickle files,
            adds them to RPC requests
        - if get <trickle_ack> in RPC reply, delete trickle files
        - parse <trickle_ack> in RPC reply
    - use safe_strncpy for shared-mem graphics messages

            at least 50% of the results have infeasible_count > 20
            (it used to be > 0, i.e. a WU could be marked as COULDNT_SEND
            when it was infeasible for even a single host)
        - Some hosts (Macs) report their memory size (host.m_nbytes)
            as a large negative number.
            Change this so that the min memory size is 64 MB

    - BOINC how has a project.xml file (by default in the same location as
      config.xml) that can contain database information:
        - projects
        - platforms
        - core versions
        - apps
        - app versions
    - this information used to be added one at a time using the `add'
      command-line tool; now there is a new tool `xadd' available, which
      parses project.xml and adds anything necessary.

    - refactored configxml.py into boincxml.py and configxml.py:
        - boincxml.py contains generic XML utility code
        - configxml.py contains code specific to config.xml and run_state.XML
        - external interface to configxml.py unchanged

    - new projectxml.py that parses and writes project.xml

David  Jan 12 2004
    - change team account so that team gets (and keeps) credit
        for results of users while they belong to team:
        - add team_id field to result
        - add expavg_time field to team
        - validator increments team credit
        - scheduler fills in result.teamid
    - don't delete empty teams
    - rename result.client_version_num to result.app_version_num
        populate this field based on <app_version> field of stderr_out
    - change update_stats so that it doesn't compute team credit fields,
        and so that it updates expavg fields only if the entity
        has been idle for 4 days or more
    - add DB_BASE::update_field() (to update one or more fields,
        not whole record)
    - add lookup_team() to db.inc
        SHOULD ALWAYS USE FUNCTIONS LIKE THIS INSTEAD OF AD-HOC QUERIES

    - released core client 2.18 for Windows

David  Jan 17 2004
    - change logic in windows_opengl.C so that an app has no window
        when it doesn't need one.
        In particular, it has no window when it initially runs,
        so it won't wake up screensaver when an app starts.
        This requires using a window-less timer 
        to poll for messages from core client.

David  Jan 20 2004
    - added basic support for GUI RPCs in the core client.
        This allows GUIs to be implemented in a separate process.
        There can be multiple GUIs looking at the same core client.
        New classes:
            GUI_RPC_CONN: represents a connection to a GUI program
            GUI_RPC_CONN_SET: represents the set of all such connections
                has the usual poll() function.
        This is currently implemented only for UNIX, using UNIX domain sockets.
        Should be straightforward to do in Win using named pipes.
    - The isspace() macro crashes if called with a non-ASCII arg,
        so use it only after isascii()
    - reimplement strip_whitespace() to do the above,
        have it trim at both start and end,
        and make a version for string
    NOTE: the real problem is that user-supplied text is being
        kept in XML elements in the state file.
        Should escape it.

        that is more or less a clone of the state of the core client.

    - server-side support for anonymous platform mechanism
        - struct CLIENT_APP_VERSION represents an app version
            that an anonymous-platform client says it has
        - SCHEDULER_REQUEST has a vector of CLIENT_APP_VERSIONs,
            parsed from request message
        - in scan_work_array(): if anonymous platform,
            instead of checking for an app version in the DB,
            check that the client has an app version with an
            acceptable version#

    NOTE: for this to work you need to add an entry named "anonymous"
    to the platform table

David  Jan 26 2004
    - client-side support for anonymous platform mechanism
        - To use this mechanism, user puts a file "app_info.xml" in a project dir.
            This file contains <app>, <file_info>, and <app_version> elements
            for app versions present in the project dir
            (compiled or manually installed by the user).
        - If this file is found, the project is marked as "anonymous_platform"
            and app/app_version info in the state file is ignored.

    - GUI RPC: get_state RPC now returns active tasks and file xfers

Rom    Feb 2 2004
    - Added a diagnostics library for project clients
        Currently only windows specific stuff has been implemented for the
        BOINCASSERT and BOINCTRACE.
        BOINCASSERT has been defined as an ASNI C assert
        for all other platforms.

        boinc_trace(), boinc_diag_init(), and boinc_diag_cleanup()
        need to be defined for all the other platforms.
    - Moved stderr redirection into boinc_diag_init() for the Windows client.

    - Fixed the windows_error_string routine so it'll report back windows system errors.
    - Updated the CreateProcess part of app.c to report OS Errors based on the above funtion.
    - Removed the seperate header blocks for both release and debug and made them the same.
        clears up one customer bug on Windows NT 4.0 platforms
    - Changed the 1400 version check in stackwalker.h to 1310 which is what the 7.1 compiler
        version is really.

    - BOINC API: if get a REREAD_PREFS message from core client,
        only call the app's reread_prefs function if there's a window open
        (the SETI@home reread_prefs function goes into an infinite loop
        if there's not a window open)

    - more misc. make_project fixes

David  Feb 4 2004
    - define a destructor for ACTIVE_TASK.
        Do all resource deallocation (close thread/proc/msg handles;
        detach and/or destroy shmem) here.
        This deallocation was being done piecemeal;
        for example, it wasn't being done if the process was aborted.
        Hence the "quit message" object was still there,
        and when another process started in the same slot it would
        immediately get the message (caused "reset project" problem)
    - Eventually delete all ACTIVE_TASK objects.
        The following removed them from the list but didn't deleting:
        ACTIVE_TASK_SET::abort_project()
        ACTIVE_TASK_SET::restart_tasks()  (failure case)
    - Don't ask for work if we have any unfinished work.
        This is a temporary kludge to prevent repeated work requests;
        it means that min work buffer is meaningless.
        But maybe this is OK.

    - Cleaned up the project-reset logic a little:
        - first garbage-collect, THEN unlink and delete the apps and app_versions
    - When detach project, delete FILE_INFO*s.

    NOTE: there are lots of loose ends, e.g. files/sockets left open etc.

Rom    Feb 5 2004
    - Microsofts documentation on the matter of SHGetFolderPath seems to be wrong.
        instead of relying on it, just do a dynamic link and call the function
        if successful.

David  Feb 5 2004
    - db_dump: files ordered by ID now have a fixed-size ID range,
        not a fixed # of elements
    - Changed FEASIBLE_COUNT parameters to very large values,
        so that results are never classified as COULDNT_SEND.
        This mechanism is not needed for SETI@home (all results are the same)
        and is occasionally screwing things up.
        Can revisit this later.
    - Make "host" web links consistent ("---" if ID is zero)
    - In UOTD browse, show only profiles w/ pics

    - Moved the unhandled exception filter back into boinc_api.c where it was orginally.
    - Moved stackwalker that is used by BOINC Client applications into api folder since
        the unhandled exception filter depends on it.
    - Removed the unhandled exception filter init code from boincdiag.cpp

Rom    Feb 6 2004
    - Removed boincdiag.cpp,h from build and encorporated all its functionality into
        boinc_api.c, h
    - Improved unhandled exception filter to handle STACK_OVERFLOW exceptions, using
        new stackwalker code base, STACK_OVERFLOWs would have caused a nested
        exception issue that would have masked the real error.
    - Improved unhandled exception filter to handle ACCESS_VIOLATIONs better, using
        stackwalker code base, giving some of the same information for release builds
        that is given in debug builds
    - Created a new macro called BOINCERROR which will trip the management thread into
        gracefully exiting the process with the correct exit code.  This macro will work
        across debug/release builds.  Some more work has to go into the base function,
        hopefully in tomorrow.

David  Feb 6 2004
    - ask for more work when # of results in progress is less than # CPUs
    - when get an APP_VERSION in a scheduler reply that's already in client state,
        DON'T update the client state (it can't be any different anyway)
        This fixes a garbage-collection crash
    - Win client: added check_state.C to the project.
        You can call check_all() to verify the integrity of client data.
        This is commented out but useful for debugging.
    - FILE_XFER_SET::insert() adds item to list, even if the underlying
        HTTP_OP::insert() fails (because can't connect, e.g.)
        This is necessary to make sure that the FILE_XFER remains in the
        FILE_XFER_SET even in case of error, so that check_all() works.

        NOTE: the semantics of insert() should be reexamined through the whole
        FSM stack.  Does it initialize?  Is it guaranteed to insert?
        Need consistency.

    - enable the min_core_version attribute of app_version:
        don't send a result to a host whose core version is too low.
        (Note: this is a no-op unless you set min_core_version
        to something nonzero).
        If a host isn't sent any work because of this,
        send a message suggesting upgrade
    - Core client: put an <exit_status> element at the top level of <result>,
        not within <stderr_out>
    - Scheduler: parse <exit_status> from within <result>
        Also parse it within <stderr_out> for backwards compat
    - Client state file not parsed correctly when it contained a <file_xfer>

      to project.inc that are now required.
    - Updated the schema.sql file to include columns that are now required.
    - Changed URL handling to include URL_BASE before quite a few relative links.

      but needed to snapshot the source.
    - Fixed a bug where on Windows we were not really waiting for three seconds before
      a retry.  This is done for both reads and writes since on Windows there is a notion
      of exclusive reads which would make successive read requests fail as well.

    - Include file overhaul for the Windows platform

      Basically the linker was linking Windows GUI resources into it because of various
      references to afxwin.h, these have now been banished from the source tree except in
      one location.

      I added a header file called stdafx.h which contains all the includes for all the
      system header files on Windows, each source file contains a pointer to stdafx.h.

      stdafx.h contains conditional logic to switch between afxwin.h and windows.h depending
      on whether or not _CONSOLE is defined.

    Edits to change when the client considers a result to be at its deadline
    it was originally 6 hours as defined in _BASE
    if I did this right it will use the connected fraction to modify that amount
    a 100% connected client will use the base figure, a 0% connected client will
    use the base figure times the multiplier in addition to the base figure.
    The figures I have here will produce a maximum time before deadline of
    18 hours. 6*2=12+6=18 for debugging that may be too much but
    it may not be enough for release.

    - Another static/dynamic linking problem fixed by an ugly collect2
      hack.  It turns out that a statically linked linux client gets the 
      following warning at build time:

    hostinfo.C:230: warning: Using 'gethostbyname' in statically 
    linked applications requires at runtime the shared libraries 
    from the glibc version used for linking

      and sure enough, when such a client is run on a linux platform
      with a incompatible glibc, we saw the following:

    2004-03-12 11:07:57 [BOINC] Can't resolve hostname setiboinc 
    2004-03-12 11:07:57 [BOINC] Can't resolve hostname setiboinc 
    2004-03-12 11:07:57 [http://setiboinc/ap/] Couldn't read master 
      page for http://setiboinc/ap/: error -113
    2004-03-12 11:07:57 [http://setiboinc/ap/] Couldn't read master 
      page for http://setiboinc/ap/: error -113

      check for URL error
    2004-03-12 11:07:57 [http://setiboinc/ap/] Detaching from project - 
      check for URL error 

      So we needed to link dynamically to libc but statically to libstdc++
      (for reasons described elsewhere in these notes).  The only way found
      so far to do this is via a hand crafted collect2 line.  That, and
      not linking the client statically in a global fashion.

      We should make the collect2 scripts adapt to the environment in
      which they ar run.  Or, better, figure out how to do this all
      within configure/make.

    - Various changes to the way CPU benchmarking is done,
        motivated by the need to make claimed credit constant across CPUs,
        including "hyperthreaded" X86 CPUs
        Old:
            A single process runs the benchmark.
            This gets 100% of the FPU on a HT CPU.
            When 2 copies of an app are run,
            they will each get 50% of the FPU,
            so the claimed credit will be too high by a factor of 2.
        New:
            Run N copies of the benchmark in parallel,
            where N is the number of CPUs reported by the OS
            (e.g. twice the number of HT CPUs)
            Average the results.
        Revised interface:
            start_cpu_benchmarks() starts up the N benchmark processes
            cpu_benchmarks_poll() checks for completion
            are_cpu_benchmarks_running() returns true iff running (doesn't poll)
            abort_cpu_benchmarks() aborts processes
        The set of running processes is maintained in an
            array of BENCHMARK_DESC structures
        Results are passed back in files in the Unix case,
            where we use separate processes.
            In the Windows case (where we use threads)
            results are passed back in the BENCHMARK_DESC structure.

        If a file is deleted (e.g., manually by the user)
        the core client should download it again before starting the app.

     - tagged as seti_boinc_app_release_2_32 and released to alpha.

David  April 3 2004
    - added a mechanism to handle situations where an app
        appears to have exited successfully,
        but in fact didn't call boinc_finish() or exit(0).
        This apparently can happen on various platforms, don't ask me how.
        The new mechanism:
        boinc_finish() writes a file "boinc_finish_called"
        in the slot directory.
        When an app appears to have exited successfully,
        the core client checks for the existence of this file.
        If it's not there, the result is placed "in limbo":
        it takes up a slot, but the app isn't restarted.
        If the core client is restarted, the app is restarted.

        NOTE: when we release a core client with this feature,
        it's critical that all users reset the project,
        and that updated versions of all apps are released.
        Might be a good time for a major release increment.

    - synchronize access to shared-mem work array by scheduler processes,
        with the goal of NEVER sending the same result to different hosts.
        - Instead of a single bool present flag, there are now 3 states
            for an element in the array: absent, present, and
            "checked out" (being considered for sending)
        - There's now a semaphore that a scheduler process must acquire before
            examining the state field of an array entry
            (note: the feeder creates this semaphore,
            but doesn't have to acquire it
            because of the producer/consumer situation).

    - ACTIVE_TASK::request_exit() (win): kill the process immediately,
        instead of sending it a quit request event,
        waiting a few seconds, then killing it.
        Currently the quit request event is checked only in
        boinc_time_to_checkpoint(),
        which (at least, in SETI@home) isn't called very often.
        So it always takes 5 seconds to exit the core client.

    - Fix a major error in back-end logic (found by Jeff):
        The canonical result's output files (and WU input files)
        were being deleted when all results had server_state = OVER.
        But this doesn't mean they've been validated!
        So the third result from every group of three
        was failing validation about half the time
        because the canonical result output files had been deleted.

        The fix: delete canonical result and WU files only when
        all results are OVER *and* all results with outcome SUCCESS
        have been validated.

David  April 9 2004
    - Fixed a nasty bug that caused back-end processes
        to corrupt records in the "result" table, and potentially others.
        The Bug:
            - escape_string() replaces ' and \ by \' and \\ respectively;
                this is done so that they can be used in SQL statements, e.g.
                update foo set blah='abc\'def';
            - escape_string() (which can increase the length of a string)
                didn't check the size of its output buffer
            - The stderr_out field of results with stack traces
                often are near their 4KB limit,
                and have LOTS of \s (in file paths)
            - escape_string() was writing beyond the end of the
                stderr_out field, writing garbage into fields
                like batch, claimed_credit, etc.
        The Fix:
            add a "len" argument to escape_string(),
            and use safe_strncpy() to avoid writing off the end of the buffer.

    - Changes in the parsing of WU template files:
        - Any unrecognized elements in a <file_info>
          are now just copied to the output.
          So you can include attributes like <sticky/>
          and they'll get propagated correctly.
        - The following items can now be included in a WU template:
            rsc_fpops_est
            rsc_fpops_bound
            rsc_memory_bound
            rsc_disk_bound

            max_total_results
            max_success_results

            These are not copied to the output,
            but are used to populate the WORKUNIT
            (which is now passed in as an arg)

    The latter means that 'create_work' (the cmdline program) is simplified;

            start daemon processes
            wait 10 seconds
            remove stop_sched
        which is necessary to give the feeder a "head start"
        on deleting and creating the shared memory segment.

      each app version per platform.

      NOTE: The query isn't smart enough yet to exclude invalid platform to
            version combinations.  For instance currently Linux is on version
            302 and Windows is on 301, but the report will still show results
            for Linux 301

    - extend the set of signals that are treated as "external",

        rather than treating it as error:
        SIGHUP, SIGINT, SIGQUIT, SIGKILL, SIGTERM, SiGSTOP
        Note: some of these should in principle never happen
        because they're caught by the API.

    - Server: remove MEDIUM_BLOB_SIZE and use LARGE_BLOB_SIZE instead.
        MEDIUM_BLOB_SIZE was used in various C structs
        to hold database blobs for:
            app_version.xml_doc (list of files in app)
            result.xml_doc_in, xml_doc_out (output files)
            result.stderr_out
            wu.xml_doc (input files)
        It was defined as 4KB, which overflowed if you had
            more than 10 or so files (with signatures etc.)

    Note 1: this greatly increases the size of WORKUNIT and RESULT,
        to I decreased the number of WU_RESULTs in shared memory
        from 1000 to 100.
        Eventually we might want to redefine the shared memory
        so that it doesn't store the entire structs
    Note 2: these buffer overflows should have been caught early-on,
        i.e. when the workunit, result or app_version was created.
        We should never just do a strcpy() or even safe_strncpy();
        instead, we should check for overflow, return error if so,
        then do the copy.
        I added some code to do this in workunit and result generation;
        still need to do this for app_version (in Python)

    - Massive simplification of STARFIELD implementation.
        Instead of using the same 3D coordinate space as other stuff,
        stars now have their own -1..1 type coordinate space,
        and we do the perspective transformation ourselves.
        This eliminates the need for all the is_visible() crap.

        The goal was to get rid of the hang/crash when the user
        moves the viewpoint too far away,
        but I ended up rewriting the (crufty) code.

        Got rid of get_matrix_invert()

        But it's not clear that the Whetstone number
        should be interpreted as MFLOPS.
        If you want to check it out, add a call to whetstone(10, x) somewhere,

David  May 21 2004
    - API: changed timer period from 50 Hz to 1 Hz.
        This timer is used only for reporting progress and CPU,
        not for doing graphics, to 1 Hz is enough
    - API: if setup_shared_mem() returns error, set standalone = true.
        This means that if you run an app standalone,
        it will be detected automatically,
        so no need for command-line args or even
        standalone argument to boinc_init()
        (but leave that arg in for now)
    - API: initialize fraction_done to -1,
        and only report it to core client if >= 0
        (i.e. don't report it unless app specifies it)
    - API: removed
        #ifdef HAVE_SYS_SHM_H
        #ifdef HAVE_SYS_IPC_H
        around calls to attach_shmem in non-Win case.
        This not an appropriate place for these ifdefs.
    - core client: ACTIVE_TASK_SET::check_app_exited():
        skip tasks in state PROCESS_IN_LIMBO.
        This avoid core client spinning when apps misbehave.
    - core client: changed variable names in app.C:

        and stops when the file goes away.

    Note: some aspects of the FILE_XFER/HTTP_OP/NET_XFER hierarchy

    - Support for "compound applications" (such as climateprediction.net)
        in which a main program runs several apps in sequence.
        The items are:
        1) The app init file now contains fields
            <fraction_done_start> and <fraction_done_end>
            giving the fraction-done range occupied by the app.
            Note: the app calls boinc_fraction_done() with values
            from 0 to 1 as usual.
            The API implementation takes care of scaling them
            to the start..end range.

            The main program must fill in these fields and call
            boinc_write_app_init_file() prior to running each app.
        2) boinc_finish() fills the final CPU time into the
            APP_INIT_DATA struct, then calls boinc_write_app_init_file().
            This passes the CPU time along to the next program.
        3) got rid of boinc_child_start() and boinc_child_done().

    - Added a mechanism for limiting the number of results
        sent to a given host in a given day.
        - added 'nresults_today field' to host DB table
        - added 'daily_result_quota' element to config.xml and SCHED_CONFIG
            (optional - gives max results per host per day)
        - change server logic so that the host record is updated
            after calling send_work()
        - change server logic to enforce daily result quota,
            send message to user if quota exceeded,
            also write log message if this happens
    - Added script to send email to all opted-in users

    - scheduler: modify_host_struct():
        modify the actual structure, not a copy

    - in strcpy2(), use strlcpy instead of strncpy
        strncpy() always copies the full N bytes,
        which is inefficient when there are long (64KB) fields
        that are short or empty.
        strlcpy() does what we want - it only copies significant bytes,
        but doesn't go off the end of the destination buffer.
        I also commented out the version of strlcpy in std_fixes.h -
        this has the same performance problem.
    - fixed "show team email addresses" function to not show auths
    - temporarily turned off user search by name and team search by name;
        we don't have indices on these fields

        So we added a class MIOFILE, with printf() and fgets() member funcs,
        that can be implemented with either a FILE* or a memory buffer
        under the hood.
    - Moved MFILE from api/ to lib/ since it's used in the implementation
        of MIOFILE
    - Changed all XML write and parse functions to take MIOFILE&
        instead of FILE*
    - Changed GUI RPC client code to use MIOFILEs
    - Changed GUI RPC protocol so that every reply message
        ends with a \003 delimiter
        (to make it unambiguous where reply ends)
    - removed version number header from GUI RPC (rethink this later)
     
    Got this all to work on Unix; will try Windows next

      - server: renamed all functions, structures and database items that
                associated with trickle_up or down and renamed to 
                msg_from_host and msg_to_host repectively,
                - Deleted result and app fields from the database entry for
                  msg_from_host (trickle_up) to make more generic of a
                  message that has no app or result associated it with it
                - Changed methods that use these fields to ignore old
                  functionality, will update when new method agreed upon

    - client: handle a "down for maintenance" RPC reply as a failure,
        i.e. do a backoff on the project.
        This should hopefully fix a problem where if
        a project is down, and a client has a result to report,
        it will do an RPC every second, creating an overload on the server.
        Do this by adding a new optional <project_is_down/> element
        to scheduler replies.
    - If get a <request_delay> from scheduler,
        don't let that override the current min_rpc_time;
        instead, take the max of the two.
    - Change the implementation of trickle messages.
        Instead of using dedicated trickle_up and trickle_down DB tables,
        use more general msg_from_host and msg_to_host tables.
        These will be used also for data management,
        i.e. to send upoad or download requests to specific hosts.

      it doesn't spend so much time waiting on the database and order by tansition_time
      so we see the oldest to the newest.

    - Added core->app heartbeat mechanism so that apps will quit
        if the core client dies
        (i.e. if no heartbeat message arrives in 5 seconds).
        Suppress this if app is standalone.
        Also provide messages that let the core disable/enable
        the mechanism (to support debugging of the core client)
    - Added a 3rd message channel for suspend/resume/quit messages,
        to replace signals.
        This isn't used now.
    - Restored code in APP_CLIENT_SHM that checks the "full" bit
        before writing a message.
        This may cause problems.

    NOTE: this is a backwards-incompatible change to the core/app
        interface, so it requires a major version change (will do later)

Eric K 30 June 2004
    - Removed "using" directives from header files.  "using"
      directives should not be used in header files for the following reasons.
      - A "using namespace" directive cannot be revoked for any source file
        including the header.  It forces the use of the namespace regardless of
        the consequences.
      - Dropping the namespace qualifier on STL templates ambiguates the
        resolution of template functions.  (How many C libraries or headers
        have you seen that define the function min()?)
      - Reducing typing is not a good reason to drop namespace qualifiers any
        more than it would be a good idea to "#define p printf"
      - Namespaces exist for a reason.
      - It's acceptable to have "using" directive in a source file, since it
        won't affect other files.  It's better to have "using std::string;" 
        directives than "using namespace std;" for hopefully obvious reasons.

David  30 June 2004

    - Changed the way result templates are stored with workunits.
        Instead of storing them as blobs,
        store a filename relative to project root dir.
        This is to speed up DB.
    - disable web command to update host credit
    - turn off web commands to show results for host/user, and pending credit
    - pruned command-line options from create_work.
        You now have to run it in project root dir,
        and it gets info from config file.

    Project note: this will require either
        1) dropping your workunit and result tables or
        2) modifying your workunit table (see ops/db_update.php)

    - API: deleted standalone parameter to boinc_init. standalone

    - Completed (more or less) the implementation of trickle messages.
        Some changes:
        - Trickle-up messages now have a "variety",
            specified by the application.
            Typically it's the name of the application.
            The trickle-up handler (on the server side) specifies what
            variety of message it wants to handle.
        - boinc_receive_trickle_down() no longer returns the message itself;
            instead, it returns the name of the file.
            The app must open, read and delete the file.

    NOTE: the structure of the msg_to_host and msg_from_host tables
        is changed.  Projects will want to drop and recreate these.

      - Changed client so that when a file info is compared to 
        an existing file info with the same name, the differences 
        in whether it is an upload or download are updated and 
        any urls that are not present in the file info are added to the url list.
    - When a url is requested for a file info, the file info 
        checks whether it is an upload, and then looks for the 
        substring "file_upload_handler" any url it is trying to 
        use to upload the file. The opposite is true for downloads.

    - Changed get_url into three separate functions:
            get_current_url(bool), returns the current good url
            get_init_url(bool), returns the initial good url and sets the start url
            get_next_url(book), increments current_url and finds the next good url

    - Changed client so that a file_info will save its signed xml 
        even if it doesn't include have xml signature. 

    - Updated the client so that the check to see if the url is 
        valid for the type of network request is a private function of FILE_INFO

    - Modified the backoff_retry function in persistant_file_xfers 
        so that it uses the updated get_url that checks if the url
        is correct for the type of transfer. Otherwise it could 
        increment the current_url index to point to an invalid url

     - If a file_info doesn't have a max number of bytes and a new 
        file_info with the same name does, update the max number 
        of bytes of the existing file_info and add the <max_nbytes> to the signed_xml. 

    - when file_xfer is complete, the client checks if the file 
        was meant to be uploaded when present OR generated locally 
        before setting it to ready to report, instead of only the later

    - With the addition of multiple urls, the issue of sending urls
        that didn't communicate well or got garbage. Whenever a file 
        get's a server error, it calls, check_giveup, which only gives 
        up on the file if there are no more urls to try. Also is called 
        if the downloaded file is garbage or has the same name but not the
        correct size.

    - added functionality for send_file_list but does not do anything yet

    - Removed ';' from queries that had them since the API Docs state
        not to put them in the query.
    - Implement a scheduler optimization so we do one batched read and one 
      transactional write.  In the worst case scenario where the client
      had submitted 20 results we would do 41 reads and 40 writes
      just to update the results.
      Now we batch read all the results at one time and surround
      the write requests within a transaction.
      So now our worst case scenario is 2 reads and 40 writes within a 
      transaction.

      some time processing when there were quite a few messages to go through,
      such as in Predictor@home
    - Moved the code that checkes the total number of messages available in
      the message tab out of the switch/case chunk of code so that it happens
      more frequently than when the user clicks on the messages tab, which
      could take awhile if there was more than 1000 messages.

          3. the result had an upload error

    - Implement revised core/app interface

            add a channel for suspend/resume/quit messages
            (these replace the use of signals and SuspendThread calls);
            add separate channels for trickle up/down

            Currently works for Windows; will do UNIX later
        - Modify the core client (app.C) accordingly
        - Call ACTIVE_TASK_SET::poll() even when activities suspended;

    - got the new core/app interface working on Unix.
        I looked into implementing the management functions
        using a thread (with pthreads).
        But the pthreads interface is kinda bizarre.
        E.g. you can't suspend another thread.
        You can send it a signal - but the signal handler
        is not allowed to make any pthreads calls!  WTF???

        This makes the feeder's DB query somewhat faster (I think).

    - Integrate code (courtesy of James Drews) that lets you limit

        Here's how it works: make a file "remote_hosts"
        in the BOINC directory with a list of hostnames (# for comment).
        The core client will accept connections only from
        localhost and from hosts in this list.
        Note: if the -allow_remote_gui_rpc option is given,
        ALL connections are accepted.

            get_file_transfers() returns info about file transfers

    - top_*.php: forgot to exit() in case of too-large offset
    - xml_escape(): change \n to space

        in case there's no work and client not returning results.
        Don't do this if this is initial request from host
        (otherwise it won't get hostid, and will detach project)
    - add "enforce_delay_bound" to SCHED_CONFIG
        (NOTE TO PROJECTS: unless you pub <enforce_delay_bound/>
        in your config.xml, the scheduler will send results

    boinc_gl.h. Include-file issues including makefile issues have yet to 
    be resolved so this will NOT compile with your existing Makefile
    - updated graphics_api with xwin_graphics_event_loop and some new
    included files. Will not compile with existing Makefile.

    Various changes to reflect the fact that message-passing
    operations may fail because buffer is full,
    in which case they must be retried later.

    - in graphics API: don't ack graphics mode in set_mode();
        instead, ack it in timer_handler()
    - in core client: keep track of the graphics_mode_requested
        separately from the graphics_mode_sent;
        in a polling routine, if these are different then try to send.

        For some reason, the transitioner wasn't expanding UPLOAD_URL

    - Database optimization in the transitioner:
        add several results in a single SQL insert statement
        (using values (...),(...),(...))
        instead of separate inserts.
        This is enabled by a BATCH_INSERT compile flag in transitioner.C
    - Add a USE_TRANSACTIONS flag to transitioner.
        Leave it off for now.
    - For some reason we weren't processing the UPLOAD_URL symbol
        in result templates.
        Restore this, using the info in the config file.
    - transitioner: if anything fails (result creation, WU update), quit.
    - result.random must be initialized by caller on insert
        (not too relevant since we don't use it anymore)
    - start/commit_transaction are now members of DB_CONN
        rather than DB_BASE_SPECIAL
    - scheduler: in scan_work_array, do all "cheap" checks
        (i.e. those that don't require DB access)
        before releasing the semaphore.
        Thus if all the results are infeasible,
        we'll acquire/release the semaphore once, not 100 times.

    - Worked a bit more on the caching... Improvements include....
        - A parameter file html/project.sample/cache_parameters.inc that
      contains the cache TTL values for differing types of files, maximum
      cache size and minimum free disk space in the cache directory.
    - Reducing the cache TTL to 0 for a specific file type results in
      caching being turned off for that file type.
    - The cache now has 256 subdirectories to speed up file open times.
    - The cache directories will be automatically built if they don't exist
      when first called
    - The cache size is checked every CACHE_SIZE_CHECK_FREQ page accesses.
      If the max size or min free space are exceeded, file are purged in
      order of age until the cache size is below the cutoff.

    - changed the API to handle compound applications.
        API tasks are broken down into a number of boolean
        "options" (struct BOINC_OPTIONS).
        For compound apps, the controller and worker call a new
        function boinc_init_options(), specifying which tasks
        they're going to handle.
        This reads the API init file, attaches shared memory,
        and starts a timer (which does only the requested tasks).

        The old boinc_init() still exists (with no args now).
        It is to be used by single-process apps.
        It calls boinc_init_options() with all options turned on.
    - Add the core client version to the API init file;
        if the app has the wrong API version file, it quits.
    - Core client: if an app gives us a trickle-up message,
        do a scheduler RPC.

    - Initial support for hierarchical upload/download directories.
        With large directories (100,000 - 1,000,000 files)
        Solaris and NFS burn too much CPU time searching dirs.
        Our plan is to use a 2-level hierarchy,

        <uldl_dir_fanout>x<uldl_dir_fanout>
        A fanout of 1024 should work OK for up to 1M files.
        A couple of utility programs in tools/:

    - Added my data management code for client. Full documentation is avaiable
      on the BOINC website under Disk Space Management. Major changes to the
      client are as follows:
        - When a file is sent to be downloaded, it is associated with a project
          which checks if there is enough space on disk
        - Files are deleted when this space, as set by the user prefs, fills up
        - Instead of sending the user prefs to the scheduling server, three 
          new values are sent and the server decides how much work to award
          each host based on these values and config.xml prefs (documented)
        - Files have a priority and expiration date which sorts them for
          deletion purposes
    - Uploaded my tools for sending and getting files to and from a host.
    - Uploaded a tool that requests a file list from all hosts, although it has
      not been fully implimented on the core client
    - Uploaded a tool that sends a request for a host to delete a local file

    - Changed server software to use the hierarchical directory mechanism.
        This means using dir_hier_path() to generate the pathname
        of an input or output file,
        rather than just concatenating directory and filename.
        Also (in process_wu_template()) use dir_hier_url()
        to generate the appropriate URL
    - Add a scheme for transitioning from flat to hierarchical download dir.
        Can have a <download_dir_alt> element in config.xml,
        giving the path of an old, flat dir.
        file_deleter will look here if it can't find file in main download dir.

        This should make it possible to use shared-library files in Mac OS/X
        that have to reside in the slot dir.
        This was done by factoring out file-setup code into a function
        (setup_file()) that's used for all files (app, input and output)
    - Deleted code for file-descriptor-based application access to

        This is no longer the case because, for example,
        the "no work available" logic now skips DB access.
        Fixed a few bugs related to this:
        - scheduler: send user/host/team info only if
            the corresponding record was read from DB
        - client: get team name, user credits, host credits

        "if (is_high_priority)".
        db->mysql is a pointer, and is always nonzero.
        It's not a flag saying whether the DB is MySQL.

    - Fixed nasty bug in feeder that has been present since April 3 (doh!).
        scan_work_array() scanned the work array with logic of the form
            if (wu_result.state == PRESENT) {
                ...
            } else {
                // assume wu_result.state == EMPTY
            }
        but with the introduction of the CHECKED_OUT state,
        this became invalid, and the feeder was overwriting entries while they
        were "checked out" by a scheduler.
        Fixed this by changing if() to switch()
    - Added check to scan_work_array(): when read result from DB,
        make sure result.workunitid matches the WU's ID.
        This ensures correctness even if the feeder is wrong.

    - Cleanup and bug fixes in CPU scheduler
        There was inconsistent terminology,
        e.g. a task could have scheduler_state = CPU_SCHED_RUNNING
        but actually be suspended; it could have state = PROCESS_RUNNING
        but actually be suspended, and so on.
        New terminology:
            "executing" (formerly "running", which was used ambiguously)
            CPU_SCHED_SCHEDULED (formerly CPU_SCHED_RUNNING):
                the CPU scheduler has given its permission
                for a task to execut; it may not actually be executing
            PROCESS_EXECUTING: the process is executing (not suspended)
            PROCESS_SUSPENDED: the process is suspended
        new function: ACTIVE_TASK::process_exists():
            true if the state is EXECUTING, SUSPENDED, or ABORT_PENDING
            Use this instead of (state == PROCESS_RUNNING) in many cases
        renamed ACTIVE_TASK::task_exited() to has_task_exited()
        changed logic in ACTIVE_TASK_SET::suspend_all()
        ACTIVE_TASK_SET::unsuspend_all():
            Removed code that checks for process exit.
            Poll code should take care of this.
    - enabled preemption by quit
    - add MSG_CHANNEL::send_msg_overwrite(): send message even

    - API: if suspended, check for <quit/> messages as well as <resume/>
        (this affects Unix only)

     - Win98 machines seem to be throwing a SEH stack overflow exception.
       Our unhandled exception filter in this case allocated a 1MB memory buffer
       and pointed the ESP register at it.  Well this chunk of code seems to

     - Win98 has a memory leak condition in dealing with memory mapped files.
       So lets go ahead and fix one possible way to slow down the leak, A better
       fix is to recycle the shared memory segments.  Recycling of the shared
       memory segments is forthcomming.

David  31 Aug 2004
    - Don't delete shared-memory segment while ACTIVE_TASK is preempted
        via quit (hopefully will fix Win98 problem).
    - Add shmem_seg_name field to ACTIVE_TASK
    - Factor ACTIVE_TASK::get_shmem_seg_name() out of write_app_init_file().
        It had no business being there.
        In particular, write_app_init_file() is sometimes called
        in the middle of execution, when you definitely don't want
        to create a new shmem seg name
    - write_app_init_file() doesn't take APP_INIT_DATA arg
    - define type SHMEM_SEG_NAME (for uniformity across platforms)

    - feeder/scheduler:
        We were seeing problems where the shared-mem array was
        filling up with results that were "locked" by a particular
        scheduler process, which apparently had then died,
        leaving that slot in limbo.
        Add code to the feeder to check if the process that
        locked a slot still exists, and unlock it if not.
    - end_cache(): check for ".." in params string.
        We've had problems with files mysteriously disappearing,
        and it's possible that the caching mechanism has a security loophole.

    - BUGFIX: Moved the delete shared memory code to the end of the function, to
      happen right before slot directory cleanup.  The previous instance of code
      t8hat was commented out was for the unix branch.
    - BUGFIX: The shared memory enumerator had a bug where the name it was
      enumerating wasn't the same name that was eventually locked by the start 
      routine, this caused the client to only be able to run one application at
      a time
    - BUGFIX: The shared memory enumerator was still referencing the slot
      directory number instead of the for loop iterator.
    - BUGFIX: When a process has been preempted, it's pid handle and thread handle
      need to be freed.
    - BUGFIX: Calling MapViewOfFile on Win98 automatically causes a memory leak,
      so don't call it unless we really have to.

          for me.

    - If an executable file failed validation, any results using
        that app version would hang forever in the "downloading" state.
        Two changes were needed to fix this:
        1) garbage_collect(): when scanning results,
            check for download failures of APP_VERSION files
            (as well as WU files), and if so mark the result as failed.
            Added new functions APP_VERSION::had_failure() and get_file_errors().
        2) handle_scheduler_reply(): if get an APP_VERSION that we already have,
            reset any errored-out FILE_INFOs,
            i.e. give it a chance to download again.
            There are various ways to do this, but this seems the cleanest.
            Added new functions FILE_INFO::reset()
            and APP_VERSION::clear_errors()
    - made verify_downloaded_file() into a member function of FILE_INFO.
        It now sets the error_msg field to a descriptive string
        so that failures will be reported to project

    NOTE: check_giveup(), handle_xfer_failure(), and retry_or_backoff()

    - If an app exits with zero status but no finish file,
        instead of putting it in limbo (which causes the core client to do no work)
        just restart the process again.
        NOTE: eventually we should detect when this is happening repeatedly,

    - (from Ben Herndon)  Some compilers optimize away sections of the Whetstone
        benchmark function, since their results aren't used outside the function.
        To deal with this, we added an global-scope array (extern_array[])
        and store the result of each section into it.
        Also changed section 3 by initializint j from the extern_array,
        so the compiler can't optimize out all the conditionals.

    - Change the validator to handle the case where one or more
      of the result files for a WU's result set can't be read.
      Currently, this case results in this WU and its results
      never getting looked at again - no science, no credit.

      We distinguish 2 cases:
      1) transient failure, e.g. an NFS mount is not working.
         (can't read directory)
         In this case check_set() returns a special code to the validator,
         which arranges for the WU to get transitioned again in a few hours.
      2) permanent failure (file doesn't exist)
         The result's validate_state is set to ERROR (new state),
         which is generally equivalent to INVALID
    - add new WU arg to check_set()
        (so it can access min_quorum)

      This is coordinated seti_boinc / boinc change.
      This note is repeated in the seti_boinc checkin_notes.

      seti_boinc changes:
        - get_result_file(), if it cannot read the result file,
          tries to read the directory where the result file should be.
          If it can read the directory, it returns ERR_FOPEN, as before.
          If it cannot read the directory, it resturns ERR_OPENDIR.
          ERR_OPENDIR in this context signals a possibly transient problem.
          Upon a successful result read, it sets sah_result.have_result
          (a new data member as of this change) to true.
        - check_set(), upon return from get_result_file() :
            - sets result.validate_state to VALIDATE_STATE_ERROR (a new state)
              and retval to zero if there is a nonzero retval from check_set()
              and it is not ERR_OPENDIR.  It then continues.
            - otherwise just continues.
          check_set() then determines if any IO errors brought the result count
          below wu.min_quorum.  If not, it continues.  Otherwise it returns.
          In all subsequent logic any results for which
          sah_result.have_result == false are skipped.
          Note that the result and the sah_result vectors are associated.

            sah_result.h
            sah_validate.cpp
            sah_boinc_db.cpp

        boinc changes:
          - new validate state VALIDATE_STATE_ERROR.
          - in the enumeration for check_set(),
            we now include a clause to check for VALIDATE_STATE_INIT
            in order to ignore results set to VALIDATE_STATE_ERROR.
            This enumeration query now matches that for check_pair().
          Note that the only possible retvals from check_set()
          are now zero or ERR_OPENDIR.
          Note that logic to retry possibly transient errors still needs
          to be done.
          Also left to be done is a transitioner change to subtract
          the number of results in state VALIDATE_STATE_ERROR
          from the count of active results.
          The latter change is needed to stimulate the production
          of additional results for the affected WU.

    - Ending the venue debacle, part II: The Client

        1) Each project maintains its venue separately.
        It's stored in the project's account file,
        and is used to select the project prefs variant.

        2) Let P be the project that's the source of the global prefs.
        Then P's venue is used to select the global prefs variant.
        (Note: P's venue may change without the global prefs changing).
        This venue is stored in the CLIENT_STATE.main_host_venue
        and in the client state file; it survives even if P is detached.

        So the basic logic is:
        if you get a new venue from project P,
        re-parse its project prefs.
        If in addition P is the source of the global prefs,
        re-parse the global prefs and put the venue in CLIENT_STATE.main_host_venue
    - got rid of CLIENT_STATE::parse_venue()
    - don't send host_venue in scheduler request

David  11 Oct 2004
    - changed the graphics API to support Mac OS/X
        (in which only the original thread can do GUI stuff).
        boinc_init_graphics() now takes a function-pointer arg
        for the worker function; it runs this function in a new thread,
        and the calling thread does the GUI event loop.

        Did this for Windows, and attempted to make the same changes
        in the Mac and X11 code.  May or may not work.

    - got rid of everything related to the GRAPHICS_INFO structure.
        This wasn't being used.

    NOTE: this change doesn't affect the core/app interface.
    No need to recompile existing apps.

David  14 Oct 2004
    - Core client: change the poll paradigm a little
        OLD: all the poll functions get called,
            at least once a second or more often when there's activity,
            e.g. network traffic.
            The problem: some of the poll functions (e.g. garbage collect)
            do a lot of work, and in periods of network activity
            they get called hundreds of times/sec.
        NEW: all poll functions take a "double now" argument.
            Those that only need to run every second can
            keep track of the last time called, and return false
            if not enough time has gone by
    - Clarify meaning of TIME_STATS::active_frac:
        it is the fraction of total time
        (NOT time that core client is running)
        that core client is enabled to work
    - CLIENT_STATE::compute_work_requests():
        Don't divide by active_frac in computing work request;
        the scheduler already does this!!
    - Core client: don't use time_t for times.  Use double.
    - garbage collect: delete an unused FILE_INFO even if
        it has an active PERS_FILE_XFER.
        (Delete the PERS_FILE_XFER first.)
    - API: fix crashing bug if app_init_data.xml file isn't there
    - Graphics API, X version: wait for initial message
        before doing anything (since GLUT needs a window)

        This is a by-product of recent graphics changes:
        boinc_init() was getting the current thread handle and assuming
        it's the worker thread, which is not the case now.
        Fix: use a single variable for worker thread handle;

    - Fixed the following problem with graphics apps on Unix:
        - the worker timer handler (on_timer) was set up in boinc_init();
            this is called in the main thread,
            which for graphics apps ends up being the graphics thread.
        - the call to getrusage() in on_timer() was returning
            the CPU time of the graphics thread, not the worker thread
        - there doesn't seem to be a way for one thread to
            get the CPU time of another thread
        Solution: (unfortunately requires a change to the API):
            apps that use graphics now call either
            boinc_init_graphics() or
            boinc_init_options_graphics()
            and DON'T call boinc_init()

        This code wasn't taking into account how long ago
        the average credit was computed.
        The fix: add functions user_inactive_days() (host/team also)
        If the user's expavg_time is older than a week,
        call user_decay_credit() to decay the average credit.
    - create a PHP function update_average(),

    - Updated BOINC Manager so that it can detect which Window Station
        and Desktop it is currently executing in,
        and pass that info off to BOINC when needed.
    - Updated the CC so that it doesn't try to act like a screensaver anymore,
        so now we can have a unified screensaver experience.
    - Updated the CC to pass the Window Station and Desktop information
        to the science application so it can transition into the screensaver
        desktop when the user
        has the password checkbox checked on NT based platforms.
    - Updated the shared memory structures for passing the extra information
        that is now needed.

     - Fixed RESULT form on ops page so that it now covers correctly
       all possible states (including ones with value 0) and
       eliminated the 'Unknown' values that previously appeared on the form.
       These were in error.  This is a clean fix, by defining (for example)
       outcome='CHOOSE_ALL', eg a non-numerical value, for the 'select
       ALL' case.
     - Added a select menu for validate_state to the RESULT form.

    - UNIX applications graphics:
        Use atexit(), setjmp() and longjmp() to pop the stack
        and resume within xwin_graphics_event_loop()
        when exit() is called in the graphics thread.

        This means that we can use the standard GLUT library,
        not our modified version.

        Thanks to Bruce Allen for suggesting this!!!!

    [Note inserted by Bruce the next day. ANSI-C 4.6.2.1 says: "The
    longjmp function ... The longjmp function should not be called in
    an exit handler (i.e., a function registered with the atexit
    function (see 4.10.4.2)), since it might jump to some code which
    is no longer in scope."  This should be OK on OSes that delay image
    teardown until after calling the handler functions, provided that
    the routine calling exit() has cleaned up its memory. An
    alternative might be to use dlopen() or the loader to replace the
    calls to exit() with a BOINC routine.]

    - Bug Fix: When BOINC is running as a service, make sure that we can display
        some simple status messages about the progress of the projects.
    - Bug Fix: Allow the apps to detect if they can support graphics, because
        of the Window Station and Desktop change, if not report back to the
        CC that graphics are not supported.
    - Bug Fix: Configure the screensaver so that is can reestablish a connection
        to the CC in case the core client is shutdown in the background, and
        restarted.
    - Bug Fix: Use the project name in the system status message instead of the
        result name.
    - Bug Fix: Screensaver now works even when BOINC is running as a service.
        NOTE: This currently only works if the account is LocalSystem and
        Interact with Desktop is checked.
    - Bug Fix: When the service account is switched to an account that cannot
        support interact with desktop make sure the screensaver can display
        the project status.
    - Bug Fix: If we have to report back that graphics are not supported in
        the current configuration, don't create the window, it only makes
        the system jittery.  I suspect it has something to do with the
        possibility of garbage UI events being sent to the application.

        and lower_case email address before inserting into database.
        Added script  make_emails_lowercase.php which
        goes through user database and changes email addresses to lowercase,

        It should be safe to run this script any number of times,
        on a damanged or undamaged user database, with no side effects.

    - Changed PHP code so that the "generated on" text
        produced for cached pages appears inside the <html> tag
        for HTML pages, and doesn't appear at all for XML output.
        
        Cached pages must now call page_tail(true) rather than page_tail().
        This function, not end_cache(), prints the "generated on" text.

    - Added static volatile const char *BOINCrcsid="$Id:..."; string to
      the top of all .C files.  This means that 'string' or 'ident'
      run on an executable will tell you the exact file versions used
      in building it, since CVS replaces $Id:... with a complete version ID
      string.  Declaration is volatile so that the compiler won't remove
      it even under agressive optimizations.

    - Fixed initialization bug where calling boinc_init_graphics()
      would not initialize options correctly, creating
      lockfile/finished havoc in graphics APP.  Thanks Reinhard!

    - Bug Fix: Undue the change made this morning relating to the STARTUPINFO structure,
        specifying the startup parameters causes the first call to ShowWindow to be
        ignored, which means we would have to make a second call.  This however, isn't
        the bug E@H ran into.
    - Bug Fix: With older clients that didn't specify the window station and desktop in 
        the share memory buffer, we ended up calling both OpenWindowStation and OpenDesktop 
        with their lpszWindowStation and lpszDesktop parameters being an empty string, which
        is an undefined behavior.  Apparently Windows returns a valid handle instead of NULL 
        and sends the application into another window station and desktop.

    - put keys in home/projects/PROJECT/keys, not in home/keys
    - socket.gethostname() seems to return the full domain name on Linux.

        no consensus, and #success results == target_nresults,
        increment target_nresults

    - Use exclusively UNIX time (1970-origin) on Windows.
        Previously we were using times in both this format
        and in Windows 1601-based format.
        This is a bug waiting to happen (in fact, it had already happened).
    - convert a few remaining absolute times from int to double
    - Add a function validate_time().
        This sees if its arg is in Windows format
        (greater than now + 1000 days)
        and if so converts it to UNIX format.
    - Call validate_time() after parsing all absolute times
    - in old GUI, show %done of file uploads correctly

    - Bug Fix: Each view now contains a display cache; the display cache
        is synchronized during the regularly scheduled list render event.
        The control grabs the necessary information from the cache instead
        of cycling down to the document.  Due to the way listviews were 
        implemented on some platforms I believe this will fix some refresh
        problems where the data wasnt being updated in a timely manor.
        This also had the added benefit of increasing performance on displaying
        updates.
    - Fill in the missing piece for the memory leak detection to proplerly
        display the file and line number information per allocation for the
        GUI on Windows

    - added script for fixing the problem where some workunits
        have target_nresults successful results and no consensus.
        The script finds WUs in this state and sets their need_validate flag;
        the validator (MAKE SURE YOU'VE RECOMPILED WITH CURRENT SOURCE)
        will increment target_nresults and trigger the transitioner,
        which will create a new result.

    - Bug Fix: On certain versions of Windows it might be necessary for the
        screensaver to force the foreground window depending on the state in
        which the screensaver was launched.  This is the slightly less
        aggressive way to do this.  Ideally the active process is the screensaver
        and so therefore can promote another process into the foreground.

    - Fixed a nasty bug in the scheduler.  Under a number of possible
      error conditions, handle_request.C would read only some fields of
      and existing request into memory, and then write more of those fields,
      some of which were null, back into memory.  This had the effect of nulling
      out outcome, client_state, exit_status, cpu_time, xml_doc_out, stderr_out,
      validate_state, claimed_credit and client_version.  The point is that
      DB_SCHED_RESULT_ITEM_SET::enumerate() followed by
      DB_SCHED_RESULT_ITEM_SET::update_result
      did not preserve an 'existing result'.  It wiped out the fields above.

    - Redid 'fix' to scheduler bug from 3 December 2004.  In fact the
      fix was incomplete. In order for it to work as intended, I would
      have also had to modify SCHED_RESULT_ITEM::parse to copy the
      additional needed fields into the in-memory structure.  But this
      is fragile.  The next time some additional fields are added to the
      result table, they would have to be incorporated here as well, to
      ensure that SET followed by UPDATE is the identity operation.  So
      I did a more graceful and robust fix.  Simply set result.id=0 for
      those results that have already been received or which for other
      reasons should not be modified in the database, then skip these
      when updating.

    - Fixed 'time to checkpoint' problem under Win32 with pure C code.
      It turns out that MS VC++ up to version 4.2 defines bool as INT.
      But more recent VC++ defines bool as CHAR.  This broke
      boinc_time_to_checkpoint() under Win32, when used within pure ANSI
      C code, if you treated the return value as a bool. So this patch
      defines bool as char if using C under recent MS compilers.

      David, a better solution for API functions that should be
      callable from C is to make them return 'int' not 'bool'.
      Probably ditto for Fortran. Sigh.

    - Added priority field to workunit and result tables.
        Can be used to prioritize work dispatch
        (implemented; run feeder with -priority_order option)
        and to give higher priority to retries (not implemented)
    - Added mod_time field to workunit and result tables.
        This is stored in a MySQL format (12-char ASCII representation)
        Need to add an index for this.
    - add "batch" and "priority" args to create_work
    - renamed host.workseq_next to host.hr_class
    - added "avg_turnaround" field to host table.
        Use this to keep track of average result latency.
        Use this for "performance homogeneous scheduling"
        (neither of these implemented yet)
    - add new DB fields to db_dump.C, db_purge.C
    - changed "account ID" to "account key" everywhere
    - Python code: all Python is now copied to project/bin.
        Eliminate the "Boinc" module.
        boinc_path_config.py is no longer used by anything
        in the project side, and it doesn't exist in project/bin.
    - At conclusion of account creation,
        send user to the BOINC site to download the core client.
        We no longer expect projects to store the core client
        in their DB or download directory.
    - The email telling users their account key now takes into
        account whether this is a new account,
        whether it needs to be validated,
        whether the user clicked "remind me of my key", etc.
    - Web: improved and reorganized the display of general prefs
    - client: don't redirect stderr/out on platforms other than Win
    - when add project, check for empty URL or authenticator
    - removed code (already commented out) that tells the server
        what other projects the host is attached to.
        This could be viewed as an invasion of privacy.
    - create_work: error-check that enough input files are listed
    - remove limit of 10 output files
        (small change to process_result_template())
    - default uldl_dir_fanout (for new projects) is 1024

    NOTE: this checkin requires that you update your database.
    See html/ops/db_update.php

    TODO: if you type <OUTFILE_0> instead of <OUTFILE_0/>
    in a result template it screws things up.

    - Bug Fix: Under the previous arrangement there was a timer event that would
        fire off once a second to check for the possiblility that the item in the
        list view had been deselected.  We weren't receiving a deselection event
        for single selection controls.  So I've ripped out the timer code and
        trapped the controls click event, and check the controls state.

        If we are a single selection control and the current selection is different
          from the row that has focus, then manually send the deselection event.

        If we are a multi selection control, check to see if anything is selected,
          if not, then manually send the deselection event.

        This has the added bonus of making our UI seem faster.

        me nuts.

            that the app won't run unless the required libraries
            (openGL, X11) are present.
        2) Graphics code in a separate shared library.
            The main program calls a new function boinc_init_graphics_lib(),
            giving it the name of the shared library.
            This function tries to open the library.
            If this fails (e.g. because X11 libs aren't there)
            it runs the application without graphics.
            Otherwise it calls the graphics initialization routine
            in the library, which creates the graphics thread.

            This case is tricky because the library's initialization routine
            can't directly call boinc_init() (from boinc_api.C).
            Doing so requires boinc_api.o to be linked with the library,
            which gives it separate copies of all the static variables.
            This produces a situation where, e.g., there are two copies of
            "fraction_done"; the one in the main program gets updated,
            the one in the library remains zero and
            gets reported to the core client.

            To solve this problem, the library's initialization routine
            takes a pointer to boinc_init() as an argument,
            and calls it via that pointer.
            boinc_api.o must NOT be linked with the shared library.
            
        Bruce Allen thought up the idea of doing graphics
        in a separate library.

    - Fixed a bug in the validator that could cause WUs to
        get stuck in a state where they have no canonical result,
        no results in progress, and no transition scheduled.

        1) After calling check_set(), count the number "nsuccess_results"
        of results that still have outcome == SUCCESS
        (this may have changed, since check_set() can change
        the outcome to VALIDATE_ERROR).

        2) If check_set() fails to find a canonical result,
        always schedule an immediate transition.

        3) If nsuccess_results >= target_nresults,
        set target_nresults to nsuccess_results+1.
        This ensures that the transitioner will make a new result,
        even in pathological cases (e.g. nsuccess_results > target_nresults)

        David, here's a rough pass, I haven't even tried to compile
        it. Please read comments in-line.  I think the major
        shortcoming is
        that most (all?) apps will want to use 'handle' to resolve their
        own functions to communicate data from worker to app graphics.
        Perhaps we should provide an additional argument to
        boinc_init_graphics_lib() for that purpose?  At the right point,
        after sucessful dlopen(), boinc_init_graphics_lib() will call
        that user-supplied function (if not NULL) passing it handle.
        On return boinc_init_graphics_lib() will then carry on and start
        graphics.
        It's fun working on a file that's not in Makefile.  No guilt!

        Code in the app's graphics shared library (including x_opengl.C)
        must not directly reference variables in the main program
        (e.g. app_client_shm) because it will have "shadow" copies of them.

        Changed the graphics_impl interface so that the shared library
        function gets passed a pointer to a structure (BOINC_MAIN_STATE)
        containing everything it will need to access.

        This is a first pass.  May need to add more to BOINC_MAIN_STATE.
        And should clean up .h file structure so that compiler will
        enforce constraints.

    - Fix a bug where a result could potentially bounce back
        and forth between the transitioner and the validator.
        This could happen if there are min_quorum success results,
        and there's no consensus.
        The fix:
        - added new value for result.validate_state:
            VALIDATE_STATE_INCONCLUSIVE means that check_set()
            was called for the result and it didn't find a canonical result.
        - The transitioner sets workunit.need_validate
            if there are min_quorum success results,
            and at least one is VALIDATE_STATE_INIT
            (no change - this is how it currently is)
        - validator:
            consider results that are both INIT and INCONCLUSIVE
            If check_set() doesn't find a quorum,
            set all result states to INCONCLUSIVE

        Thanks to Kjell Nedrelid (Rattledagger) for finding this.
    - added logic to admin HTML to show INCONCLUSIVE state

        I spent the better part of the day trying to figure out
        how I might change the execution sequence so that changing the
        ALLUSERS property based on the SETUPTYPE field would yield the right
        redirection of the default folders
        but it seems that the folder properties are handled via the
        MSI engine itself and without a bit more knowledge I'm not
        sure how to do it.  But this only affects
        those installing via the commandline or via some mass deployment
        scenario and so just throwing an error is okay.
        The errors describe the problem and how to fix it.

        The UI handles this automatically,
        so the average install scenario won't have to worry about this.

        in the p_vendor field if a processor identifier was being detected.

    - modify scheduler to handle bad host IDs gracefully.
        E.g.: it a project accidentally deletes its host table,
        things will eventually return to normal without
        users having to detach/reattach

        Old logic:
        look up host based on request.hostid
        look up user based on host.userid
        if user.authenticator != request.authenticator
            send error message and delay request

        New logic:
        look up host based on request.hostid
           If not found, create new host record and return its ID
        look up user based on request.authenticator
        if no such user
           send error message and delay request
        if host.userid != user.id

    -  Spent several hours tracking down a problem that turned
       out to be the fact that sizeof(bool) is not consistent
       even across gcc.  It's 4 bytes on gcc 2.95, 1 byte on 
       gcc 3.0, 1 bytes on gcc 3.3 on x86 and 4 bytes on gcc 3.3
       on OSX.   Botton line: one MUST eliminate bool from any
       library object that's meant to be used in the public
       API available from C.  I started fixing this across more
       of the API but got nervous that this would break the E@h
       builds and cause even more delay.  So did a minimal fix
       for now: changed boinc_time_to_checkpoint() to return int.

    - core client: change WORKUNIT::command_line from char[256] to std::string.
        This increases the limit on cmdline length from 256 to 8192
        (there's still a fixed-size buffer in the Unix startup code).

        It turns out there were no limitations on the server side.

        Also, change the representation in the core state file from
            <command_line>blah</command_line>
        to
            <command_line>
                blah
            </command_line>
        to accommodate long command lines (can be many lines).
        Each line is limited to 4096 chars
    - process_wu_template(): replace a 64KB buffer with a std::string.
        There's still a 64KB length limit,
        but this way overruns are caught and reported
        instead of create_work crashing.

    - make X/Unix graphics not fail if GLUT calls abort(3).  This
      generated a SIGARBT.  We now catch this signal.  In the
      graphics thread, this just restarts the graphics init process
      (with some sleep(2)ing if needed to prevent a busy fail loop).
      If the signal is caught in the main thread, we restore the old
      signal handler then raise(SIGABRT).

      David, note that when run standalone, killing the graphics
      window does NOT kill the process.  I think this is fine, but
      it doesn't correspond to what the documentation says.

    - When creating large numbers of WU which have large input files,
      the cost of computing the md5 sums becomes expensive.  Inserted
      a simple caching mechanism into the utility function
      process_wu_template().  For a given filename FILENAME, this looks
      for a file called FILENAME.md5, which contains the md5sum and
      length.  If the file exists, these values are used.  If not, such
      a file is created.  Since (I think) David is planning to have a
      database for files, this mechanism will eventually be obsolete.
      Right now it disabled by default.  Use -DBOINC_CACHE_MD5 to
      enable it.

    tools/
        backend_lib.C

Bruce  31 Dec 2004

    - Some improvements on the md5-info caching.  If the 'data' file is
      more recent than the 'md5info', then ignore md5info.  If md5info
      has *exactly* the right format (no extra or missing characters) then
      remove it in this case (only).  Don't write an md5info file if
      another file is found with the same name.  Thus if someone has two
      data files called X and X.md5, unless X.md5 has the exact correct
      syntax for an md5-info cache file, it won't be removed or used.
      Still disabled by default.  Use -DBOINC_CACHE_MD5 to enable it.

    - Improvements to ops/ pages, from Christian Beer.  Show all fields of
      WU.  Display status summaries based on mod-times.

    - Make 'grep logs' function assume default of *.log for filenames, unless
      specified.

    - Bug Fix: The new gui should enforce closing down the core client
        when it launches the core client, we were using the wxWidget
        framework to do this, but the call to wxProcess::Exists causes
        an assert on Windows if the process doesn't exist.  And sometimes
        crashes in a release build.
    - Bug Fix: When syncing the views cache make sure there is at least
        one item to syncronize, otherwise we'll reference a NULL pointer
        and blow up.  This fixes the crashing bug when you startup and
        shutdown the core client in the background.

      couple of weeks to fix a number of bugs and problems in the

      handling problems seen on a number of Unix file systems. A
      brief summary of the changes is:

      lockfile: replace calls to exit() by boinc_finish() + make
      boinc_finish() remove the lockfile

      graphics-eventloop: some re-structuring and simplification to
      make handling of glut-exits/abort-signals more robust.  Eric,
      if you could test this under Solaris we'd be very grateful.

Bruce 8 Jan 2005

    In order to coordinate better with David, I am doing a slightly
    premature checkin of modifications to scheduling locality.  The
    basic idea is to provide a simple notification mechanism to the
    project, so that if no work is currently available for a given
    data file, there is an opportunity to make such work.  This is
    controlled by an additional tag in config.xml, of the form:

    <locality_scheduling_wait_period> N </locality_scheduling_wait_period>

    where N is some number of seconds.  If this new tag is absent,
    then the locality scheduler behaves as before.

    The modification to behavior happens in send_results_for_file().
    This is the function that queries the database to see if there are
    unsent results available for a given (large) data file on the
    host.  Previously, if such results are not found the scheduler
    gives up and tries sending other results.  With this modification,
    if N is nonzero, then if no results are found the scheduler
    touches a file with the same name as the host's data file, in a
    directory
       PROJECT_ROOT/locality_scheduling/need_work/
    The scheduler then sleeps for N seconds, and makes one additional
    attempt to find suitable unsent results. The idea is that in this
    interval, the project has an opportunity to make additional WU for
    this file, which the transitioner can convert to unsent
    results. [Note, the transaction for the first query is completed
    before the sleep(N), and a new transaction is initiated
    afterwards. So there is no 'sleep within a transaction'.] This
    delay allows the project to make additional workunits suitable for
    the host's existing data files.

    In addition, if the project determines that NO further workunits
    can be made for a given data file, then the project can touch a
    file with the same name as the input data file, in a directory
          PROJECT_ROOT/locality_scheduling/no_work_available/
    If the scheduler finds this warning then it assumes that the
    project can not manufacture additional WU for this data file and
    skips the 'notify, sleep, query again' sequence above.  Of course
    it still does the initial query, so if the transitioner has made
    some new results for an existing (old) WU, they will get picked
    up.

    This mechanism is robust in the sense that if the signals fail for
    any reason, or (say) the WU are not converted into unsent results
    quickly enough by the transitioner, or if they are snapped up by
    some other host, then the scheduler simply proceeds as with its
    current unmodified behavior and nothing goes wrong.  In other
    words, the signals can be ignored at any time and for any time
    without adverse consequences.

    TODO: further testing.

David  8 Jan 2005
    Some changes related to locality scheduling:

    - Factored Bruce's new code into a separate function,
        make_more_work_for_file()
    - Remove the 'id>X' stuff from queries.
        Assuming that work is fairly homogeneous
        (i.e. no results are rejected because of resource requirements)
        this is not needed.
        If a result has already been sent,
        it won't qualify for the select anyway.
    - Add a 'workunitid<>X' clause to the queries.
        This is to make the process of enforcing the
        one_result_per_wu_per_user rule more efficient.
        If the rule is not in effect, X is zero (so always true)
    - If two consecutive select queries return the same result,
        break out of the loop (avoid undesired looping)
    - Use a for i=1,100 loop instead of a while(1) loop
        around the work-sending logic,
        to avoid infinite loops just in case

    sched/
        sched_locality.C

David  8 Jan 2005
    - Implement the <locality_scheduling_wait_period> element in config.xml
        If present, this tells the scheduler how long to sleep
        between requesting more work for a file
        and looking for it (and giving up if it's not there)
        If absent, the scheduler doesn't request more work unit generation.

David  10 Jan 2005
    - locality scheduling changes:
        Changed the algorithms a bit to avoid lots of DB queries
        Invariant: for a given file/user pair,
            results are sent in order of increasing ID
            (i.e. the result sent is that with the smallest ID
            among all those that CAN be sent).
            This ensures that:
            - the result for given WU will be sent around the same time
        send_results_for_file():
            1) of results for this file sent to this user,
                find the one R with largest ID
            2) find unsent result R2 for this file with next ID greater than R,
                and (if one result per user per WU) different workunitid than
                ALL previous results sent to this user.
            3) if need more results, set R = R2 and go to 2)
        send_new_file_work():
            min_id = 0
            while need more work
                find unsent result R with id>min_id of least ID
                min_id = R.id
            (Note: this is necessary to preserve the invariant)
        Changed make_more_work_for_file() to return zero for success
            (BOINC convention)

    more locality sched changes (with Bruce Allen)

    - Added a notion of "working set" of files.
        If a host doesn't have a file, the scheduler picks a
        random entry from the working set and tries to send it
        work from that file.
        The project must supply a daemon program that maintains the working set
        (could be the same as the work generator)
    - Added config.locality_scheduling_send_timeout.
        If any unsent result is older than this,
        send it to the first eligible host
    - If a host already has files, randomize their order
    - Integrate work-generator invocation in send_results_for_file()
    - If can't send a result because of no app_version, give up

    more locality sched changes.
    - bug fix 1, trivial, n % 0  generates FPE if no files.
    - bug fix 2, subtle.  In the deterministic hunt to find
      the next unsent result, the comparison of the result name must be
      done with the lexically maximum result name constructed from the
      given filename.  Eg, if one needs name>FILE_ZZZZ...Z where
      Z=0xff (is this charset independent??) and the total name length
      is 255 (or is it 254??).

    - David, I'll clean out some of the debugging scaffolding in a few
      more days, when I get some confidence that there are not other
      problems to fix!  Please read embedded comments/questions in code.

    - Some more comemnts added later.  We do sometimes get non-zero
      return values from possibly_send_result().  I think that this is
      because you've failed to match up the start_transaction and
      commit_transaction pairs.  Be careful: sleeps AND modifies the
      DB.  Right now I am too tired to fix this without making it worse.
      Your turn.

    - A few other comments.  Currently, I am 'advertising' filenames
      returned by get_working_set_filename() for TWO types of files:
      (1) those for which I can make more work
      (2) those for which I can NOT make more work, but where you have
          not flagged with flag_for_possible_removal().
      I am not sure that I understand the intent of
      flag_for_possible_removal().  You surely are not guaranteeing
      that no results will ever appear in the future for these files
      (outstanding results might fail).  So what is my WU generator
      supposed to do with flag_for_possible_removal?  Is (2) above
      correct? 

     - Finally, I have not yet seen a SINGLE instance of a
       flag_for_possible_removal.  Is the logic right?

Bruce  13 Jan 2005
    - Various efforts to fix CVS 'loginfo' file so that we get auto
      mailings of changes to the top level directory.  The main problem
      is that one can't use "^boinc[ ]" or "^boinc\ " or
      "^boinc\#20" as a regex to try and match the name of the top
      level directory with no trailing slash. What a mess! 

    - More work on sched_locality.C.  Note that the 'wacky' warning is
      actually not impossible.  Consider the following scenario: WU A
      has result 1 and WU B has result 2.  These are both sent to a
      host.  Some time later, result 1 fails and the transitioner
      creates a new result, result 3 for WU A.  Then the host requests
      a new result.  The maximum result already sent to the host is 2.
      The next unsent result (sorted by ID) is #3.  But since it is
      for WU A, and since the host has already gotten a result for WU
      A, it's infeasible.  So I think this is only wacky if
      !one_wu_per_result_per_host.

    - David, I simplified the inner part of send_results_for_file()
      somewhat.  I can't see the need/use for the bool bool
      in_working_set argument.  If I have really screwed the pooch
      please revert.

    - Core client: when get a workunit from scheduler,
        clear errors (e.g. download failures)
        for all files associated with this WU
        (this is down in a new function WORKUNIT::clear_errors())
        Without this, if a file common to multiple WUs had a download
        failure, all WUs would fail until user resets project!!
    - Giant bug in HTTP file transfer:
        If a network connection failed in the middle,
        it wasn't being distinguished from a completed download;
        the file size would be checked at the PERS_FILE_XFER level,
        and it would get a "bad file size" fatal error.
        Fix: when get EOF from a network connection reading HTTP reply,
        compare the bytes transferred with the content-length
        from HTTP header.
        If not equal, classify it as an error.
        This will cause higher levels to view it as a transient error,
        and restart the download later.
    - PERS_FILE_XFER::poll():
        the check for actual file size == desired file size
        was inexplicably being done even for file uploads,

        - other values indicated DB errors (e.g. lost connection to server)

        Strange as it may seem, until now we didn't have a way of
        knowing that enumerate() had errored out.

    - Additional work on locality scheduling.  
      (a) make DB queries more efficient using name>'FILE__' and name<'FILE__~' rather than
          name like 'FILE__%'
      (b) Set 'no remaining work for this file' flag correctly by making a DB scan if needed.
          One can show that this is the 'cheapest' reliable place to put this scan.
      (c) Modify deterministic algorithm for finding unsent results so that instead of
          starting with FILE="" and scanning forward over all files, it starts at a random
          place in file space, scans cyclicly to the end, and then from "" to the start
          point.
      (d) Satisfy work request if possible.  Don't terminate sending work until none left that
          is feasible, or request satisfed.
      (e) If a new file is needed, first pick file associated with unsent results which are more
          than 2 hours old.  Note: need to make this a user-configurable option, and add some
          random +- slack.
      
       For the record, here is the current locality scheduler logic.
       I will update the docs once this is a bit better tested and
       stable.

      (1) If there is an (one) unsent result which is older than
      (1) config.locality_scheduling_send_timeout (7 days) and is
      (1) feasible for the host, sent it.
 
      (2) If we did send a result in the previous step, then send any
      (2) additional results that are feasible for the same input file.
 
      (3) If additional results are needed, step through input files on
      (3) the host.  For each, if there are results that are feasible for
      (3) the host, send them.  If there are no results that are feasible
      (3) for the host, delete the input file from the host.
 
      (4) If additional results are needed, and there is (one) unsent
      (4) result which is older than 2 hours and is feasible for the
      (4) host, send it.

      (5) If we did send a result in the previous step, then send any
      (5) additional results that are feasible for the same input file.
 
      (6) If additional results are needed, select an input file name at
      (6) random from the current input file working set advertised by
      (6) the WU generator.  If there are results for this input file
      (6) that are feasible for this host, send them.
 
      (7) If additional results are needed, carry out an expensive,
      (7) deterministic search for ANY results that are feasible for the

      (7) send any additional results that use the same input file.  If
      (7) there are no feasible results for the host, we are finished:

    - Initial test-version of the moderation system
      Please test the current features (deleting posts, moving posts) and see 
      if this is how it should be done.
      The rest is mostly copy-paste work as the same design can be used for
      threads as well.

      This update includes:
           - Deleting posts
           - Moving posts
           - Sending email notice to post author
           - Users cannot edit their posts more than 1 hour after creating them
           - Deleted posts are only shown to moderators
           - Inversion of $filter_on in getThreads and getPosts (!)
             Now the bit means "show deleted posts/threads" and defaults to off
           - New special user bitfield

      Due to the new special user bitfield you must redefine who is who in your
      project. Currently this is done manually (idea for the ops page, anyone?)

      This is how the bitfield is used:
           1st bit = Moderator
           2nd bit = Project Admin
           3rd bit = Project dev
           4th bit = Project tester
           5th bit = Volunteer dev
           6th bit = Volunteer tester
           7th bit = Project Scientist
           
           So if I'm a project admin and want to be moderator as well, I would
           do the following SQL query:
           
           Update forum_preferences set special_user = '1100000' where userid=42

    - added --cron-tasks option to start
        (does periodic tasks but doesn't start daemons)
        From David Hammer.
        This should arguably be used instead of --cron
        because if daemons are crashing you'll find out about it sooner.

    - Patches from Reinhard Prix to fix several problems.
      (1) apps being suspended would call boinc_finish(nonzero) and
          core client would treat this as app failure.  Introduce
          a new function boinc_exit() and call that instead.
      (2) improvements to GUI build with wxWidgets
      (3) improved X event handling loop now ensures that X window
          is taken away when window killed.

    - From Reinhard Prix.  At Rom's request, this builds the
      Linux client using static rather than
      dynamic linking to the gcc C++ lib.  Note that modifying
      this to do the same whenever gcc is used (not just under
      Linux) might be desirable.

David  20 Jan 2005
    - Added cross-project IDs for hosts.
        This lets statistics sites show work per host, summed over projects.

        Implementation:
        Hosts generate their own "internal" CPIDs,
        using an MD5 of time/domain/IP/disk_free.
        This should be unique across that user's hosts.
        It's stored in the HOST_INFO structure and sent to server.
        The server hashes the internal CPID with the user's email address
        and stores the resulting "external" CPID in the host table.
        It is included by db_dump in <host> elements.

    PROJECT NOTE: if you use this server code you will need
    to apply update_1_20_2005() from html/ops/db_update.php to existing DBs

Rom    20 Jan 2005
    - Bug Fix: Remove some code that was keeping half of the
        check_suspend_activities conditions to be skipped.

      NOTE: basically this was causing BOINC to alternate
        between suspended mode and non-suspended mode twice
        a second because the check for user idle activity
        happened after we returned from the function which
        means that reason was returning 0, meaning we shouldn't
        be suspended.

    - Bug Fix: Setting activities_suspended should happen outside
        the check for tasks_restarted, since it is used later in
        the function, and activities_suspended may not be what
        we expect it to be.
    - Cleanup: In the idle detection routine save the needed values
        to a variable so we can see them as we are steping though
        the code, let the optimizer deal with it on release builds.
    - Bug Fix: Remove the Modify option in setup, our setup is an
        all or nothing deal.
    - Bug Fix: Configure setup for automatic upgrades, this requires
        the previous MSI databases from the builds we release to
        public.

      NOTE: I need to talk to David about this a little bit, but
        I think it is doable.
    - Bug Fix: Fix the screensaver load up problem where it was
        taking 60 seconds before the first text was displayed.

      NOTE: This reintroduces a bug where the screensaver slows to
        a crawl when boinc isn't running in the background.  I
        think I've figured out a solution to it, but I didn't get
        the code written for this release.
