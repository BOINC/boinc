    - client: scheduling problem:
        - a project overestimates job FLOP counts
        - the client starts jobs in EDF mode
        - as job progresses and fraction done increases,
            its completion time estimate decreases until
            it's no longer a deadline miss.
        - job gets preempted by other job from that project;
            you end up with lots of partly completed jobs.
        Solution (I hope): if an app version has running jobs,
            compute a "temp DCF" for the app version,
            which is the min of dynamic/static estimates for its jobs.
            Apply this scaling factor to completion time estimates
            for unstarted jobs in RR simulation
    - client: the estimation of remaining time of running jobs was wrong
        (how did this bug survive so long?)

    - client: Eliminate x86_64 Mac client; i386 client determines if

        platform accordingly.  This allows us to link with the 32-bit

    - API: if app can't acquire lock file, tell the client not
        to restart app for 10 minutes.
        Hopefully what will happen is:
        - another instance of app is running in slot dir
            (shouldn't happen, but sometimes does)
        - that app will eventually finish, and will write
            a checkpoint file saying so.
            It will call boinc_finish(0), but the client won't notice
            that it has exited.
        - the next time the client starts the app,
            it will acquire lock, see that it's done,
            and call boinc_finish(0).
            This time the client will notice,
            and the job will be reported as correct.
        The downside to all this is that the client won't know
        that the CPU is in use, and will schedule NCPUS jobs.

        the same title and description is present already.
        If so we remove one or the other, depending on the situation.

        This introduces the possibility of "holes" in the seqno space.
        In order that the manager learns of these deletions,
        we use the following mechanism:
        whenever a notice is removed (because it's a dup or too old)
        a flag is set in each GUI_RPC_CONN.
        On the next get_notice() RPC, the client returns the entire
        list of notices, preceded by a dummy notice with seqno=-1;
        this tells the RPC stub function to replace the current list
        rather than appending to it.

    - Mac Sandbox: The init_data.xml file in each slot directory also contains 
        an authenticator; to keep these private, change ownership of the "slots" 
        directory to boinc_master:boinc_project and eliminate read and execute 
        permissions of this directory for "other".  For consistency, make the 
        same changes to the "projects" directory.  The individual slot and 
        project directories are still world-executable and they and their 
        contents are still world-readable, so the Client can still read files 
        created by project apps with ownership boinc_project:boinc_project.
      - NOTE: I believe this should not cause any problems for either BOINC or 
        project applications, but it needs to be tested thoroughly.

        rather than being sent with the CPU app.
        The current architecture makes it difficult to do otherwise.

    - various components: fix inconsistencies in how user names
        and team names are represented.
        In particular, edit_user_info_action.php was using
        htmlentities() on names; this led to double-encoding.

        The new rules:
        1) no HTML tags allowed in either one.
            This is enforced silently, using strip_tags()
        2) names are stored in the DB exactly as entered.
            They may contain chars like & and >.
            They may contain non-ASCII characters
            (use UTF-8 if you want them displayed correctly).
            None of these are not escaped.
        3) When the names are put in XML
            (e.g. in scheduler reply or db_dump output)
            they are XML-escaped.
            This escapes <, &, and non-ASCII chars
        4) The client leaves them in this form,
            and writes them that way in GUI RPCs
            and init_data.xml files.
        5) The parsing of GUI RPC replies and init_data.xml files
            XML-unescapes them.

        To work around this bug, the dialog had been made resizeable and the 
        height and width were saved in the Manager settings.  But this meant 
        that when we add an item to the dialog, it is too small until the 
        user expands it.  And Modal dialogs like this should not be resizeable.
        I also made the dialog no longer resizeable by the user.

        the browser sends an OPTIONS request, then sends a POST.

        parsing the POST reply.

    - client (and anything else using MFILE): Win efficiency fix.
        Shockingly, realloc() wasn't doing exponential growth.

    - server: various changes;
        see http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/wiki/CreditNew

        Projects will need to update DB and recompile all back-end programs.

        Summary:
        - new way of computing credit
        - "reliable host" mechanism is per app version
        - "host punishment" mechanism is per app version
        - adjustment of wu.rsc_fpops_est provides the
            equivalent of per app version DCF
        - max jobs in progress is now per app
        - max jobs per RPC is now per app

        TODO:
        - reliable mechanism:
            - populate and use host_app_version.error_rate
            - populate host_app_version.turnaround
        - host punishment:
            - populate host_app_version.max_jobs_per_day
            - populate host_app_version.n_jobs_today
            - use app.max_jobs_per_day_init
        - job limits:
            - use app.max_jobs_in_progress, max_gpu_jobs_in_progress
            - use app.max_jobs_per_rpc
        - adjust wu.rsc_fpops_est
        - remove old credit stuff
            fpops_cumulative, credit_multiplier
            credit computation in scheduler

    - AVERAGE class: use the Knuth algorithm (Wikipedia)
