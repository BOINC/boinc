    - client: fix job scheduling bug.
        Scenario: we have 2 CPUs and 1GB RAM
        Project A has jobs that use 1GB.
        Project B has small-mem jobs.
        Currently, we ignore RAM usage in building the runnable job list,
        so we might pick 2 jobs from project A.
        enforce_schedule() (which checks RAM usage) will run just one of them,
        and the other CPU will be idle.
        Solution: keep track of RAM usage while building the runnable job list.

    - client: eliminate unnecessary CPU reschedules.
        Currently we do a reschedule any time a job checkpoints,
        in case there's a job that has finished a time slice
        but hasn't checkpointed yet.
        Instead: flag such jobs, and trigger a reschedule
        on checkpoint only for flagged jobs.
    - client: fix instability in job scheduling that happens
        if a job's estimated completion time in RR sim is close to its deadline.
        It can alternate between making and missing deadline,
        causing the scheduler to alternate rapidly between jobs.
        Solution: if RR sim has marked a job as deadline miss
        any time in the last (CPU scheduling period),
        treat it as a deadline miss.

        The change in [21877] caused tasks in "download stalled" state
        to be skipped in RR simulation,
        and therefore to not be counted in the work buffer.
        However, "download stalled" was not being evaluated correctly;

    - scheduler: fix a problem with job resend.
        When we first send a job, we pick an app version,
        then call wu_is_infeasible_fast()
        to see if the host is able to run the job with that app version.
        In addition to checking disk space etc.
        this calls wu_is_infeasible_custom() to do project-specific checks
        (e.g. for SETI@home: don't use GPUs for VLAR jobs).

        However, when we resend a job, we pick an app version
        (possibly different from the original one)
        and send the job without any checking.
        So, for example, we might send a VLAR job to a GPU,
        or send a job to a host with insufficient disk space
        (because free space has changed since original send).

        Solution: call wu_is_infeasible_fast() before resending a job,
        and if it returns true, mark the job as done and don't resend it.

        Old: at the start of simulation, call WORK_FETCH::compute_shares() 
            to get resources of runnable projects.
            Use these throughout the simulation.

        Problem: suppose you have 2 runnable projects;
            P1 has large RS, P2 has small RS.
            P1's jobs finish quickly.
            P2's jobs then are running alone,
            but their FLOPS is scaled (incorrectly) by P2's small RS.

        Solution: recompute relative CPU resource share within the
            simulation loop,
            and compute it over the projects that have actives jobs
            in the simulation.

        send a message, not a notice.
        Assume the user knew what they were doing,
        and doesn't want to be nagged.
    - scheduler: check for the existence of an app version
        before checking for user selected-app prefs.
        This prevents sending "no jobs available for selected apps"
        message when no app versions exist for non-selected apps

    - client: generalize the GPU framework so that
        - new GPU types can be added easily
        - users can specify GPUs in cc_config.xml,
            referred to by app_info.xml,
            and they will be scheduled by BOINC
            and passed --device N options
            Note: the parsing of cc_config.xml is not done yet.
        - RPC protocols (account manager and scheduler)
            can now specify GPU types in separate elements
            rather than embedding them in tag names
            e.g. <no_rsc>NVIDIA</no_rsc> rather than <no_cuda/>
    - client: in account manager replies, parse elements of the form
        <no_rsc>NAME</no_rsc>
        indicating the GPUs of type NAME should not be used.
        This allows account managers to control GPU types
        not hardwired into the client.
        Note: <no_cuda/> and <no_ati/> will continue to be supported.
    - scheduler RPC reply: add
        <no_rsc_apps>NAME</no_rsc_apps>
        (NAME = GPU name)
        to indicate that the project has no jobs for the indicated GPU type.
        <no_cuda_apps> etc. are still supported 
    - client/lib: remove set_debts() GUI RPC
    - client/scheduler RPC
        remove <cuda_backoff> etc. (superceded by no_app)
        Exception: <ip_result> elements in sched request
        still have <ncudas> and <natis>.
        Fix this later.

    Implementation notes:
    - client/lib: change "CUDA" to "NVIDIA" in type/variable names, and in XML
        Continue to recognize "CUDA" for compatibility
    - host_info.coprocs no longer used within the client;
        use a global var (COPROCS coprocs) instead.
        COPROCS now has an array of COPROCs;
        GPUs types are identified by the array index.
        Index zero means CPU.
    - a bunch of other resource-specific structs (like RSC_WORK_FETCH)
        are now stored in arrays, with same indices as COPROCS
        (i.e. index 0 is CPU)
    - COPROCS still has COPROC_NVIDIA and COPROC_ATI structs to hold vendor-specific info
    - APP_VERSION now has a struct GPU_USAGE to describe its GPU usage

    - WINSCR: So after looking over all the logs from WCG and now from Jacob
        Klein a pattern started to emerge.  At the end of the log files the last
        message logged was 0x12 which translates into WM_QUIT.  The latest
        documentation on WM_QUIT states it should never show up in the message
        loop to begin with.
        
        The docs now say that WM_QUIT should not be sent to the message loop by
        way of PostMessage.  We have been doing things this way for over 5 years.
        
        Change the shutdown logic so that only the primary curtain window can call
        PostQuitMessage() and all other curtain windows just exit when they receive
        a WM_DESTROY message.
        
        I'm not sure what causes this to be a problem on some machines and not
        others.  But preliminary results from Jacob are encouraging.

            boinc_options_defaults(options);
            options.multi_process = true;

        In this case set options.multi_thread as well.
    - wrapper: add support for multi-process apps.
        Previously, suspend/resume operations did not work for subprocesses.
        If a task is multi-process, you must include

            But for apps that checkpoint seldom or never,
            this is not the relevant value,
            and frac done may go down when the app runs.
        - fraction_done_elapsed_time is not initialized,
            and can have garbage values for jobs that haven't run yet.
        New:
        - Record, in the state file, the values of
            fraction_done and fraction_done_elapsed_time
            at the most recent checkpoint.

    - client: change the handling of account manager replies:
        Old:
            If the AM sends us a project we're already attached to,
            and the authenticator is different,
            print an error message and don't change anything.
        Problem:
            If the AM is using weak authenticators,
            and the user has changed their password,
            the weak authenticator changes.
            In this case the AM will send the new weak auth,
            the client will ignore it,
            and all subsequent scheduler RPCs will fail
            until the user removes/adds the project.
        Solution:
            If the AM sends us a new auth for a project, use it.
        Note:
            From the time the password is changed on the project
            to the next AM RPC,
            the client will have a bad weak auth and scheduler RPCs will fail.
            That's OK.

    - Change the way update_versions works, and reimplement it in PHP.
        Problems with the old version:
        - Lots of info encoded in file and directory names: messy kludge
        - The convention that directory name == main program name
            created a bad situation when using the wrapper:
            if you made a new version of your application,
            you were forced make a new version of the wrapper
            just so it could have a different name.

    - client: we were assuming that if we ask a task to exit
        and its main process exits, everything is OK.
        That's not necessarily the case - buggy apps may have
        subprocesses that the main process fails to kill.

        Solution: when we request a task to exit or abort,
        make a list of the descendants.
        When the main process exits, kill any remaining descendants.
        
        Also: we weren't checking for the ABORT_PENDING case
        in the process exit logic.
        This may explain the 5/15 second delay in detaching or
        resetting a project with running tasks

    - MGR: It turns out we want the Wizard ProjectInfo Page to check for ATI and NVIDIA 
        GPUs regardless of whether they were reported by CAL, CUDA or OpenCL, so we can 
        just check CC_STATE::have_ati and CC_STATE::have_nvidia even for newer clients.  
        This means the Manager doesn't need to do get_host_info RPCs, because all the 
        host info it needs is available from the host_info section of the get_state RPC, 
        so eliminate the unnecessary Manager calls of get_host_info RPC.

    - scheduler: fix nasty bug where SCHED_DB_RESULT::parse()
        was doing memset(this, 0, sizeof(RESULT)),
        i.e. it wasn't zeroing out the whole structure.
        The elapsed_time field (which isn't reported by old clients),
        is near the end of the struct,
        and it was getting garbage, e.g. 1e-304, in some cases,
        which led to zero credit (and maybe other problems)
    - validator: treat 1e-304 like zero in case of other problems
        like the above.

    - Improve interface of XML_PARSER.
        Add parsed_tag and is_tag to the class,
        so that parsing functions don't need to declare them
        and pass them around.
    - Complete the task of using XML_PARSER as the argument
        to all parsing functions.
        (Internally, many of these functions still use the old XML parser;
        that's the next step.)

    - Vbox wrapper: deal with checkpointing.
        Current: wrapper reports frequent checkpointing to client,
            but actually checkpoints only when the VM is stopped
        Problem: large amounts of work would be wasted if
            BOINC stops in an ungraceful way (e.g., power failure)
        Solution:
            Don't report frequent checkpointing.
            Every CPU scheduling period (typically once/hour)
            stop the VM (creating a checkpoint)
            and call boinc_temporary_exit(0).
            If the client wants to keep running this job,
            it will start us immediately.

            iterating through the vector.
            Operations are O(n)
        New: map of (id, PROCINFO),
            and each PROCINFO has a vector of its children.
            Operations are O(log(n))
        Also combined Mac/Win/Linux variants of code that
        was essentially the same.

David  2 Sept 2011
    - client/API/vboxwrapper:
        add a mechanism so that apps can report sub-processes
        that are not descendants (e.g., virtual machines)
        These processes are then counted as part of the app,
        not as "non-BOINC CPU time".
        This fixes a bug where processing was incorrectly suspended
        because CPU usage by VM apps exceeded the "CPU usage limit" pref.

        Implementation:
        - the PIDs of the processes in question
            are passed from app to client via shared-memory,
            in the app_status channel.
            A new variant of boinc_report_app_status() supports this.
        - the VBox wrapper queries the PID of the VM,
            and reports it in this way.
        - procinfo_app() includes a new argument: a list of PIDs
            that are part of the app, although not ancestrally
            related to the main process.
        - in the client, ACTIVE_TASK now includes a vector "other_pids".
            If this is nonempty, it's passed to procinfo_app().
