"recovery pass"
    the processing of a dfile by the vdad

DATA_UNIT
	int status (PRESENT, RECOVERABLE, UNRECOVERABLE)
    bool keep_present
        unit is currently PRESENT
        keep enough descendant chunks on server so that
        this unit will be PRESENT after this pass
    bool need_present
        unit is currently REC
        start enough uploads to make it PRESENT

    META_CHUNK
		bool need_reconstruct
            decode this unit during this pass.
            This is set only if some child is UNREC
		bool needed_by_parent
            this unit is needed to reconstruct parent.
            (don't delete it after reconstructing)

        invariant: if need_reconstruct is set,
            then either needed_by_parent is set
            or there are UNREC children

    CHUNK
        bool present_on_server (from DB)
        bool new_present_on_server
