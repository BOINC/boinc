CCK 6.x-2.0-rc7
===============

Note:
- There has been a few files moved around since RC6, so be sure to *delete* the previous contents
of your cck/ folder before uploading the new files, in order to avoid duplicates.
- The admin forms (field creation, field edition...) have been renamed to comply with usual form
naming conventions. Modules and custom code that rely on those form ids through hook_form_alter() or
drupal_execute() will need to be updated.
- The final 6.x-2.0 release is currently targetted for the second half of September.

Main bugs fixed since RC6:
- Content Copy: Fix multiple bugs when importing/exporting content types :
exporting field definition can alter the actual field's settings
'this post cannot be referenced' error when exporting nodereference fields
no export of default values
- #198502 D5 upgrade path: Prevent field module upgrades from running before content.module upgrades.
- #293698 Views integration: make 'show n values starting from m' actually work.
- #292872 Data loss issue: fields and field data deleted for content types defined by disabled modules.
IMPORTANT: Since disabling all contrib modules is a recommended step prior to upgrading a D5 site to D6,
it is highly advised that D5 sites using CCK are updated to CCK 5.x-1.8 (which contains the same fix)
before starting the D6 upgrade process.

Main new features since RC6:
- Updated to latest Views 2 API. Views integration requires Views 6.x-2.x-dev newer than Sep 3, 2008.
- #295556 by CPyle - Userreference: let referenceable users be defined by a View.
- Userreference: Add 'Radios / checkboxes' widget.
- #294797 New $FIELD_NAME_rendered and $GROUP_NAME_rendered variables for node.tpl.php.
- Nodereference: Allow specific node templates for nodes displayed as values of a noderef field.
- #301736 by nedjo - Nodereference: Multilingual support; if available, propose translations of referenced nodes when creating a new translation.
- #196468 by Nedjo - Content copy: Provide a link to automatically import a file into Content Copy.

Other changes:
- Avoid undefined index error in Content Copy when fieldgroup is enabled but there are no groups.
- #296077 Add delta to formatter information.
- #128038 Alter _content_admin_form() to provide the raw widget default values as well as the default value widget so programmed forms will have those values available. You can't tell when you construct the form if it's a programmed form or not, so we will always have to create the default value widget, but we don't always have to use it. This will also get the default values into the Content Copy export in a way that Content Copy import can pick them up, and alter validation to unset the default value widget and skip the default value widget processing if it's a programmed form. Since we are now provided the actual default value (not just the default value widget) in the export, we can safely pick it up in the import.

CCK 6.2.beta
============

Content Generate (new feature)
- #257874 and #187599 provide a way to auto-generate field content for the devel module.
- #261633 E_All fix for content_generate.

Usability
- #227439, #227437, #227945 Rework field and widget type handling to simplify the intial screen when choosing a field and widget type by making it a two-step process where you see only the widgets that apply to the field. Move the setting of the field label to the same place where you set the field name. Change the field edit screen to keep it from showing all the different widgets again and instead just display the current widget. Then add a button to change the widget which will take you to another screen to make the change since the rest of the page will need to change when the widget changes. Keep the changes to the widget label  in that separate process, too, since that affects the menu tabs that need to be changed before redirecting back to the main page.

Update processing
- #256141 Add old updates back to fieldgroup.install for situations where the module was briefly enabled and then disabled and never used so the update process doesn't throw an error for the missing updates.
- Fix potential E_All error in userreference after update.
- Fix E_All error that can come up after update if text module is using format column.
- Change the check in _content_type_info to be sure the new 'active' column exists before trying to query the table during installation and updates. Also fix E_All notice for non-existant db_columns during install and update.
- #237585 Try to avoid foreach errors on missing content type information by creating empty arrays in content_info.

Optionwidgets
- #224391 Get default values working again for optionwidgets.
- #251157 Make sure optionwidgets selections are not lost when previewing node.
- #253038 Make sure empty optionwidget values are always arrays.

Nodereference
- #264345 Create a nodereference wrapper for setting and rendering a view and store the rendered view in a static variable to ensure the same view is not rendered over and over in the same session.
- #263936 Make sure nodereference select views do not try to use paging and do not limit the items per page.
- Clean up autocomplete handling that uses Views as a selector.
- #262112 Add missing hook_theme definition for the plain formatter.
- #256440 Nodereference was passing wrong object to Views for the Views node selection option. Also need to limit available views to those that have fields defined so we can add the title to the view and so there is something meaningful to display in the select list.

Views Integration
- #264479 Make sure we don't try to init() a view for fields that don't have one selected.
- #263936 Set arguments in execute_display. Also make sure to pass $string and $exact_string to the view.
- #257566 Move all content fields into a single group in the Views UI.
- #242856 Make sure the node.nid is aliased when creating our grouped fields query so the parent node isn't confused with nodereference's nid column.
- #261528 Add in missing code to create the link to the node if that option is requested.

Content Copy
- #225664 Make sure groups get imported as well as fields.

Formatters
- #264768 Make sure handling for all possible states of #single is properly set up.
- #260253 $node->type isn't always set, and if missing the formatters that use $fields($field_name, $type_name) to retrieve the field array end up with an empty value. Add the node type to all content fields views so we can be sure it's available and alter the content_format logic to look for the node type both at $node->type and at $node->node_type, where Views will put it, to properly set the content type.

General
- #256116 Add a TODO to reconsider handling of CCK data when a content type is deleted.
- Small fix to content_generate to get auto-generation of number values working.
- #265334 Avoid format error messages in the unusual case where you have created CCK content and then delete the content type without deleting the node, since core does not delete the nodes in that case.
- #227256 Add an additional check when creating a new field that the length is no more than 32 characters.
- #260253 When content_type is set but empty, nothing is returned from content_fields(). Fix that by checking for empty() instead of isset(). This is a more general problem that should be fixed in content_fields().
- #258127 Eliminate need to defer the rebuild of the menu, also adding TODO to see if content_menu_needs_rebuild() can be eliminated.
- #257304 Make sure the widget description is never NULL to avoid problems when a NULL value gets wrapped with t().
- #259704 Make sure help text always appears.
- #255113 Make sure empty filtered text fields don't pick up unintended values from check_plain().
