"NFS@Home is a research project that uses Internet-connected computers to do "
"the lattice sieving step in the Number Field Sieve factorization of large "
"integers. As a young school student, you gained your first experience at "
"breaking an integer into prime factors, such as 15 = 3 * 5 or 35 = 5 * 7. "
"NFS@Home is a continuation of that experience, only with integers that are "
"hundreds of digits long."
