<p>
If you are fluent in English and another language,
you can help ".PROJECT." by translating parts of our web site
into your non-English language.
If you are interested in doing this:
<ul>
<li> Learn how BOINC's
<a href=http://boinc.berkeley.edu/translation.php>web site translation mechanism</a> works.
<li>
Contact project staff to obtain project-specific translation files,
and to get instructions for submitting translations into your language.
</ul>

<p>
You can also help
<a href=http://boinc.berkeley.edu/language.php>translate the BOINC client software</a>.
<p>

There is an email list
<a href=http://www.ssl.berkeley.edu/mailman/listinfo/boinc_loc>boinc_loc at ssl.berkeley.edu</a> for people doing translations of the BOINC client software
and web interfaces.
