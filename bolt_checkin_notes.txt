    - May as well start keeping checkin notes for Bolt.
        At this point the fundamental structure of Bolt is
        more or less complete, I hope; many features are missing.

    Items for this particular checkin:

    - Make things work right when you resume a course at an
        exercise answer page.
        This creates a new View, whose prev_view_id link points
        to the exercise view, not the answer page view
    - When leave a page using "Up", terminate the view accordingly.
    - Rather than using $_GET, Form vars are now passed to exercise primitives
        in a global variable $bolt_ex_query_string, which they must parse.

    - removed "bolt_" from API functions.
        I don't think this prefix is useful;
        Bolt isn't going to be used within large existing PHP code

    html/inc
        bolt_ex.inc

David  Feb 22 2008
    - added sketchy implementation of Maps

        inc/
